# Brier Score
Brier Score is a *strictly proper* scoring metric that is equivalent to applying mean squared error to the probabilities of a probabilistic estimator.

!!! note
    Metric assumes probabilities are between 0 and 1 and their joint distribution sums to 1.

!!! note
    In order to maintain the convention of *maximizing* validation scores, this metric outputs the negative
    of the original score.

**Estimator Compatibility:** Probabilistic Classifier

**Output Range:** -2 to 0

## Parameters
This metric does not have any parameters.

## Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\BrierScore;

$metric = new BrierScore();
```
