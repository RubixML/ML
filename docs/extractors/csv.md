# CSV
A plain-text format that use newlines to delineate rows and a user-specified delimiter (usually a comma) to separate the values of each column in a data table. Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format is a common format but suffers from not being able to retain type information - thus, all data is imported as categorical data (strings) by default.

!!! note
    This implementation of CSV is based on the definition in [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).

## Parameters
| # | Name | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | path |  | string | The path to the CSV file. |
| 2 | header | false | bool | Does the CSV document have a header as the first row? |
| 3 | delimiter | ',' | string | The character that delineates the values of the columns of the data table. |
| 4 | enclosure | '"' | string | The character used to enclose a cell that contains a delimiter in the body. |

## Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\Extractors\CSV;

$extractor = new CSV('example.csv', true, ',', '"');
```
