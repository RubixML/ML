# Dropout
Dropout layers temporarily disable neurons during each training pass. Dropout is a regularization and model averaging technique for reducing overfitting in neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ratio | 0.5 | float | The ratio of neurons that are dropped during each training pass. |

### Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Layers\Dropout;

$layer = new Dropout(0.5);
```
