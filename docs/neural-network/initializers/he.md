# He
The He initializer was designed for hidden layers that feed into rectified linear unit layers such as [ReLU](../activation-functions/relu.md), [Leaky ReLU](../activation-functions/leaky-relu.md), and [ELU](../activation-functions/elu.md). It draws from a uniform distribution with limits defined as +/- (6 / (fanIn + fanOut)) ** (1. / sqrt(2)).

### Parameters
This initializer does not have any parameters.

### Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Initializers\He;

$initializer = new He();
```
