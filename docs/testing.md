# Testing
Rubix ML utilizes a combination of static code analysis and unit tests. We provide three [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) commands that can be run from the root directory to automate the testing process.

### Static Analysis
To run static analysis:
```sh
$ composer analyze
```

### Coding Style
To run the coding style checker:
```sh
$ composer check
```

### Unit Testing
To run the unit tests:
```sh
$ composer test
```
