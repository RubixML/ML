### Strategies
Guesses can be thought of as a type of *weak* prediction. Unlike a real prediction, guesses are made using limited information. A guessing Strategy attempts to use such information to formulate an educated guess. Guessing is utilized in both Dummy Estimators ([Dummy Classifier](#dummy-classifier), [Dummy Regressor](#dummy-regressor)) as well as the [Missing Data Imputer](#missing-data-imputer).

The Strategy interface provides an API similar to Transformers as far as fitting, however, instead of being fit to an entire dataset, each Strategy is fit to an array of either continuous or discrete values.

To fit a Strategy to an array of values:
```php
public fit(array $values) : void
```

To make a guess based on the fitted data:
```php
public guess() : mixed
```
