# Recursive Feature Eliminator
Recursive Feature Eliminator (RFE) is a supervised feature selector that uses the importance scores returned by a learner implementing the [RanksFeatures](../ranks-features.md) interface to recursively drop feature columns with the lowest importance until a terminating condition is met.

> **Note:** The default feature ranking base learner is a fully-grown decision tree.

**Interfaces:** [Transformer](api.md#transformer), [Stateful](api.md#stateful), [Verbose](../verbose.md)

**Data Type Compatibility:** Depends on the base learner

## Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | min features | | int | The minimum number of features to select from the dataset. |
| 2 | max dropped features | 3 | int | The maximum number of features to drop from the dataset per iteration. |
| 3 | max dropped importance | 0.2 | float | The maximum importance to drop from the dataset per iteration. |
| 4 | estimator | Auto | RanksFeatures | The base feature ranking learner instance. |

## Additional Methods
Return the final importances of the selected feature columns:
``` php
public importances() : ?array
```

## Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\RecursiveFeatureEliminator;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\RandomForest;

$transformer = new RecursiveFeatureEliminator(30, 2, 0.05 new RandomForest());
```
