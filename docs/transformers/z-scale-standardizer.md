# Z Scale Standardizer
A method of centering and scaling a dataset such that it has 0 mean and unit variance, also known as a Z Score.

**Interfaces:** [Transformer](api.md#transformer), [Stateful](api.md#stateful), [Elastic](api.md#elastic)

**Data Type Compatibility:** Continuous

### Parameters
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | center | true | bool | Should we center the sample dataset? |

### Additional Methods
Return the means calculated by fitting the training set:
```php
public means() : array
```

Return the variances calculated during fitting:
```php
public variances() : array
```

Return the standard deviations calculated during fitting:
```php
public stddevs() : array
```

### Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\ZScaleStandardizer;

$transformer = new ZScaleStandardizer(true);
```
