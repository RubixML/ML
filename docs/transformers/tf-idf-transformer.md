### TF-IDF Transformer
*Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency* is a measure of how important a word is to a document. The TF-IDF value increases proportionally with the number of times a word appears in a document (*TF*) and is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus (*IDF*).

> **Note:** This transformer assumes that its input is made up of word frequency vectors such as those created by the [Word Count Vectorizer](#word-count-vectorizer).

**Interfaces:** [Transformer](api.md#transformer), [Stateful](api.md#stateful), [Elastic](api.md#elastic)

**Data Type Compatibility:** Continuous only

### ParametersThis transformer does not have any parameters.

### Additional Methods
Return the inverse document frequencies calculated during fitting:
```php
public idfs() : ?array
```

### Example

```php
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\TfIdfTransformer;

$transformer = new TfIdfTransformer();
```
