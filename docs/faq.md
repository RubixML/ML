# FAQ
Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked Rubix ML questions.

### What environment (SAPI) should I run Rubix in?
All Rubix programs are designed to run from the PHP [command line interface](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php) (CLI). The reason almost always boils down to performance and memory consumption.

If you want to serve your trained estimators in production then you can use the [Rubix Server](https://github.com/RubixML/Server) library to run an optimized standalone model server that implements its own networking (HTTP, TCP, etc.) layer and runs from the CLI instead of Apache server or NGINX via FPM which are much slower.

To run a program using the PHP command line interface (CLI), open a terminal and enter:
```sh
$ php example.php
```

> **Note:** The PHP interpreter must be in your default PATH for the above syntax to work.

### I'm getting out of memory errors
Try adjusting the `memory_limit` option in your php.ini file to something more reasonable. We recommend setting this to *-1* (no limit) or slightly below your device's memory supply for best results.

You can temporarily set the `memory_limit` in your script by using the `ini_set()` function.

**Example**

```php
ini_set('memory_limit', '-1');
```

> **Note:** Machine Learning can sometimes require a lot of memory. The amount necessary will depend on the amount of training data and the size of your model. If you have more data than you can hold in memory, some learners allow you to train in batches. See the section on [Online](online.md) learners for more information.

### What is a Tuple?
A *tuple* is a way to denote an immutable sequential array with a predefined length. An *n-tuple* is a tuple with the length of n. In other languages, tuples are a separate datatype and their properties such as immutability are enforced by the compiler/interpreter, unlike PHP arrays.

**Example**

```php
$tuple = ['first', 'second', 0.001]; // a 3-tuple
```

### What is the difference between categorical and continuous data types?
There are generally 2 classes of data types that Rubix distinguishes by convention.

Categorical (or *discrete*) data are those that describe a *qualitative* property of a sample such as *gender* or *city* and can be 1 of K possible values. Categorical feature types are always represented as a string internal type.

Continuous data are *quantitative* properties of samples such as *age* or *speed* and can be any number within the set of infinite real numbers. Continuous features are represented as either floating point or integer types internally.

### Does Rubix support multiprocessing?
Yes, Rubix supports parallel processing (multiprocessing) by utilizing a pluggable parallel computing [Backend](backends/api.md) under the hood. Objects that implement the [Parallel](parallel.md) interface are able to take advantage of parallel backends.

### Does Rubix support multithreading?
Not currently, however we plan to add CPU and GPU multithreading in the future.

### Does Rubix support Deep Learning?
Yes. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves forming higher-order representations of the input features such as edges and textures in an image or word meanings. A number of learners in Rubix support Deep Learning including the [Multi Layer Perceptron](#multi-layer-perceptron) classifier and [MLP Regressor](#mlp-regressor).

### Does Rubix support Reinforcement Learning?
Not currently. Rubix is for *supervised* and *unsupervised* learning only.
