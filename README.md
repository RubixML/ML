### Basic Introduction
Machine learning is the process by which a computer program is able to progressively improve performance on a certain task through training and data without explicitly being programmed. There are two types of machine learning that Rubix supports out of the box - *Supervised* and *Unsupervised*.

 - **Supervised** learning is a technique that uses a labeled dataset in which the outcome of each sample has been *labeled* by a human expert prior to training. There are two types of supervised learning to consider in Rubix:
	 - **Classification** is the problem of identifying which *class* a particular sample belongs to. For example, one task may be in determining a particular species of flower or predicting someone's MBTI personality type.
	 - **Regression** aims at predicting *continuous* values such as the sale price of a house or the position (in degrees) of the steering wheel of an automobile. The major difference between classification and regression is that, while there are a *finite* number of classes that a sample can belong to, there are *infinitely* many real (continuous) values that are possible to predict.
- **Unsupervised** learning by contrast does *not* use a labeled dataset. Instead, it focuses on finding patterns within the raw samples.
	- **Clustering** is the grouping of data points in such a way that members of the same group are more similar (homogeneous) than the rest of the samples. You can think of clustering as assigning a class label to an otherwise unlabeled sample. An example where clustering is used is in differentiating PET scan tissues or segmenting a customer base.
	- **Anomaly Detection** is the process of flagging samples that do not conform to the expected pattern of the training data. Anomalous samples can indicate adversarial activity or exceptional circumstances such as fraud or a cyber attack.
	- **Manifold Learning** is a dimensionality reduction method used in visualizing high dimensional datasets by producing a low (1 - 3) dimensional representation of the feature space.

### Obtaining Data
Machine learning projects typically begin with a question. For example, you might want to answer the question "who of my friends are most likely to stay married to their spouse?" One way to go about answering this question with machine learning would be to go out and ask a bunch of happily married and divorced couples the same set of questions about their partner and then use that data to build a model of what a successful marriage looks like. Later, you can use that model to make predictions based on the answers you get from your friends. Specifically, the answers you collect are called *features* and they constitute measurements of some phenomena being observed. The number of features in a sample is called the *dimensionality* of the sample. For example, a sample with 20 features is said to be *20 dimensional*. The goal is to engineer enough of the right features for the learner to be able to train effectively.

An alternative to collecting data yourself can be to access one of the many public datasets that are free to use. The advantages of using a public dataset is that, usually, the data has already been cleaned and prepared for you. We recommend the University of California Irvine [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) as a great place to get started using open source datasets.

Note that there are a number of PHP libraries that make extracting data from various sources such as CSV, database, and the cloud easy and intuitive, and we recommend checking those out as well as a good place to get started.

Here are a few libraries that we recommend for data extraction:

- [PHP League CSV](https://csv.thephpleague.com/) - Generator-based CSV extractor
- [Doctrine DBAL](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html) - SQL database abstraction layer
- [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries) - Cloud-based data warehouse via SQL

#### The Dataset Object
Data is passed around in Rubix via specialized data containers called Datasets. [Dataset objects](#dataset-objects) properly handle selecting, splitting, folding, transforming, and randomizing the samples and labels contained within. In general, there are two types of datasets, *Labeled* and *Unlabeled*. Labeled datasets are used for *supervised* learning and Unlabeled datasets are used for *unsupervised* learning and for making predictions (which we call *inference*). Dataset objects have a mutability policy of *generally* immutable except for performance reasons such as when applying a [Transformer](#transformers).

For the following example, suppose that you went out and asked 100 couples (50 married and 50 divorced) about their partner's communication skills (between 1 and 5), attractiveness (between 1 and 5), and time spent together per week (hours per week). You could construct a [Labeled Dataset](#labeled) from this data like so:

```php
use Rubix\ML\Datasets\Labeled;

$samples = [
    [3, 4, 50.5], [1, 5, 24.7], [4, 4, 62.0], [3, 2, 31.1], ...
];

$labels = ['married', 'divorced', 'married', 'divorced', ...];

$dataset = new Labeled($samples, $labels);
```

### Choosing an Estimator
Estimators make up the core of the Rubix library as they are responsible for making predictions. There are many different algorithms to choose from and each one performs differently. Choosing the right [Estimator](#estimators) for the job is crucial to creating a system that balances accuracy and performance.

In practice, you will test out a number of different estimators to get the best sense of what works for your particular dataset. However, for our example problem we will just focus on a simple classifier called [K Nearest Neighbors](#k-nearest-neighbors). Since the label of each training sample we collect will be a discrete class (*married couples* or *divorced couples*), we need an Estimator that is designed to output class predictions. The K Nearest Neighbors classifier works by locating the closest training samples to an unknown sample and choosing the class label that appears most often.

#### Creating the Estimator Instance

Like most Estimators, the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier requires a set of parameters (called *hyper-parameters*) to be chosen up front by the user. These parameters can be selected based on some prior knowledge of the problem space, or at random. The defaults provided in Rubix are a good place to start for most machine learning problems. In addition, the library provides a meta-Estimator called [Grid Search](#grid-search) that searches for the best combination of hyper-parmeters for a particular estimator given a set of possible values. For the purposes of our simple example we will just go with our intuition and choose the parameters outright.

> **Note**: You can find a full description of all of the K Nearest Neighbors hyper-parameters in the [API reference](#k-nearest-neighbors) guide.

In KNN, the hyper-parameter *k* is the number of nearest points from the training set to compare an unknown sample to in order to infer its class label. For example, if the 5 closest neighbors to a given unknown sample have 4 married labels and 1 divorced label, then the algorithm will output a prediction of married with a probability of 0.8.

The second hyper-parameter is the distance *kernel* that determines how distance is measured within the model. We'll go with standard [Euclidean](#euclidean) distance for now.

To instantiate a K Nearest Neighbors classifier:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\KNearestNeighbors;
use Rubix\ML\Kernels\Distance\Euclidean;

// Using the default hyper-parameters
$estimator = new KNearestNeighbors();

// Specifying the hyper-parameters
$estimator = new KNearestNeighbors(5, new Euclidean());
```

Now that we've chosen and instantiated our estimator and our Dataset object is ready to go, we are ready to train the model and use it to make some predictions.

### Training and Prediction
Training is the process of feeding the learning algorithm data so that it can build a model of the problem. A trained model consists of all of the parameters (except hyper-parameters) that are required for the estimator to make predictions. If you try to make predictions using an untrained learner, it will throw an exception.

Passing the Labeled dataset to the instantiated learner, we can train our K Nearest Neighbors classifier like so:
```php
...
$estimator->train($dataset);
```

We can verify that the learner has been trained by calling the `trained()` method:
```php
var_dump($estimator->trained());
```

#### Output:

```sh
bool(true)
```

For our 100 sample example training set, training should only take a matter of microseconds, but larger datasets with higher dimensionality and fancier learning algorithms can take much longer. Once the estimator has been fully trained, we can now feed in some unknown samples to see what the model predicts.

Turning back to our example problem, suppose that we went out and collected 5 new data points from our friends using the same questions we asked the couples we interviewed for our training set. We could make predictions on whether they will stay married or get divorced by taking their answers as features and running them in an Unlabeled dataset through the trained Estimator's `predict()` method.
```php
use Rubix\ML\Dataset\Unlabeled;

$unknown = [
    [4, 3, 44.2], [2, 2, 16.7], [2, 4, 19.5], [1, 5, 8.6], [3, 3, 55.0],
];

$dataset = new Unlabeled($unknown);

$predictions = $estimator->predict($dataset);

var_dump($predictions);
```

#### Output:

```sh
array(5) {
	[0] => 'married'
	[1] => 'divorced'
	[2] => 'divorced'
	[3] => 'divorced'
	[4] => 'married'
}
```

### Evaluating Model Performance
Making predictions is not very useful unless the estimator can correctly generalize what it has learned during training to the real world. [Cross Validation](#cross-validation) is a process by which we can test the model for its generalization ability. For the purposes of this introduction, we will use a simple form of cross validation called *Hold Out*. The [Hold Out](#hold-out) validator will take care of splitting the dataset into training and testing sets automatically, such that a portion of the data is *held out* to be used for testing (or *validating*) the model. The reason we do not use *all* of the data for training is because we want to test the Estimator on samples that it has never seen before.

The Hold Out validator requires you to set the ratio of testing to training samples as a constructor parameter. In this case, let's choose to use a factor of 0.2 (20%) of the dataset for testing leaving the rest (80%) for training. Typically, 0.2 is a good default choice however your mileage may vary. The important thing to note here is the trade off between more data for training and more data to produce precise testing results. Once you get the hang of Hold Out, the next step is to consider more advanced cross validation techniques such as [K Fold](#k-fold), [Leave P Out](#leave-p-out), and [Monte Carlo](#monte-carlo) simulations.

To return a score from the Hold Out validator using the Accuracy metric just pass it the untrained estimator instance and a dataset:

```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\HoldOut;
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\Accuracy;

...
$validator = new HoldOut(0.2);

$score = $validator->test($estimator, $dataset, new Accuracy());

var_dump($score);
```

#### Output:

```sh
float(0.945)
```

### Visualization
Visualization is how you communicate the findings of your experiment to the end-user and is key to deriving value from your hard work. Although visualization is important (important enough for us to mention it), we consider it to be beyond the scope of Rubix . Therefore, we leave you with the freedom to chose one of the many great plotting and visualization applications out there to communicate the insights you obtain using Rubix.

If you are just looking for a quick way to visualize data then we recommend exporting it to a file (JSON or CSV for example) and importing it into your favorite plotting or spreadsheet software such as [Plotly](https://plot.ly/), [Tableu](https://www.tableau.com), [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), or [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel). PHP has built in functions for manipulating both JSON and CSV formats, and there are a number of libraries available that help reading and writing these formats to file from PHP.

If you are looking to publish your visualizations to the world, we highly recommend [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) since it is an amazing data-driven framework written in Javascript that plays well with PHP.

### Next Steps
After you've gone through this basic introduction to machine learning, we highly recommend checking out all of the [example projects](https://github.com/RubixML) and reading over the [API Reference](#api-reference) to get a powerful understanding for what you can do with Rubix. If you have a question or need help, feel free to post on our Github page. We'd love to hear from you.

### System Architecture
The Rubix architecture is defined by a few key abstractions and their corresponding types and interfaces.

![Rubix ML System Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixML/RubixML/master/docs/images/rubix-ml-system-architecture.svg?sanitize=true)

---
### API Reference
This section breaks down the application programming interface (API) of each component in detail.

### Dataset Objects
In Rubix, data is passed around using specialized data structures called Dataset objects. Dataset objects can hold a heterogeneous mix of categorical and continuous data and make it easy to transport data in a canonical way.

> **Note**: There are two *types* of features that estimators can process i.e *categorical* and *continuous*. Any numerical (integer or float) datum is considered continuous and any string datum is considered categorical by convention throughout Rubix.

The Dataset interface has a robust API designed to make working on datasets fast and easy. Below you'll find a description of the various methods available on the basic interface.

#### Stacking
Stack a number of dataset objects on top of each other and return a single dataset:
```php
public static stack(array $datasets) : self;
```

#### Selecting
Return all the samples in the dataset:
```php
public samples() : array
```

Select the *sample* at row offset:
```php
public row(int $index) : array
```

Select the *values* of a feature column at offset:
```php
public column(int $index) : array
```

Return the *first* **n** rows of data in a new dataset object:
```php
public head(int $n = 10) : self
```

Return the *last* **n** rows of data in a new dataset object:
```php
public tail(int $n = 10) : self
```

#### Example:
```php
// Return the sample matrix
$samples = $dataset->samples();

// Return just the first 5 rows in a new dataset
$subset = $dataset->head(5);
```

#### Properties

Return the number of rows in the dataset:
```php
public numRows() : int
```

Return the number of columns in the dataset:
```php
public numColumns() : int
```

Return the integer encoded column types for each feature column:
```php
public types() : array
```

Return the integer encoded column type given a column index:
```php
public columnType(int $index) : int
```

Return the range for each feature column:
```php
public ranges() : array
```

Return the range of a feature column. The range for a continuous column is defined as the minimum and maximum values, and for categorical columns the range is defined as every unique category.
```php
public columnRange(int $index) : array
```


#### Splitting, Folding, and Batching

Remove **n** rows from the dataset and return them in a new dataset:
```php
public take(int $n = 1) : self
```

Leave **n** samples on the dataset and return the rest in a new dataset:
```php
public leave(int $n = 1) : self
```

Split the dataset into *left* and *right* subsets given by a **ratio**:
```php
public split(float $ratio = 0.5) : array
```

Partition the dataset into *left* and *right* subsets based on the value of a feature in a specified column:
```php
public partition(int $index, mixed $value) : array
```

Fold the dataset **k** - 1 times to form **k** equal size datasets:
```php
public fold(int $k = 10) : array
```

Batch the dataset into subsets of **n** rows per batch:
```php
public batch(int $n = 50) : array
```

#### Example:
```php
// Remove the first 5 rows and return them in a new dataset
$subset = $dataset->take(5);

// Split the dataset into left and right subsets
[$left, $right] = $dataset->split(0.5);

// Partition the dataset by the feature column at index 4 by value '50'
[$left, $right] = $dataset->partition(4, 50);

// Fold the dataset into 8 equal size datasets
$folds = $dataset->fold(8);
```

#### Randomizing

Randomize the order of the Dataset and return it:
```php
public randomize() : self
```

Generate a random subset with replacement of size **n**:
```php
public randomSubsetWithReplacement($n) : self
```

Generate a random *weighted* subset with replacement of size **n**:
```php
public randomWeightedSubsetWithReplacement($n, array $weights) : self
```

#### Example:
```php
// Randomize and split the dataset into two subsets
[$left, $right] = $dataset->randomize()->split(0.8);

// Generate a bootstrap dataset of 500 random samples
$subset = $dataset->randomSubsetWithReplacement(500);
```

#### Filtering

To filter a Dataset by a feature column:
```php
public filterByColumn(int $index, callable $fn) : self
```

#### Example:
```php
$tallPeople = $dataset->filterByColumn(2, function ($value) {
	return $value > 178.5;
});
```

#### Sorting

To sort a dataset in place by a specific feature column:
```php
public sortByColumn(int $index, bool $descending = false) : self
```

#### Example:
```php
...
var_dump($dataset->samples());

$dataset->sortByColumn(2, false);

var_dump($dataset->samples());
```

#### Output:

#### Prepending and Appending
To prepend a given dataset onto the beginning of another dataset:
```php
public prepend(Dataset $dataset) : self
```

To append a given dataset onto the end of another dataset:
```php
public append(Dataset $dataset) : self
```

#### Applying a Transformation
You can apply a fitted [Transformer](#transformers) to a Dataset directly passing it to the apply method on the Dataset.

```php
public apply(Transformer $transformer) : void
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\OneHotEncoder;

...
$transformer = new OneHotEncoder();

$transformer->fit($dataset);

```

### Labeled
For *supervised* Estimators you will need to train it with a Labeled dataset consisting of samples with the addition of labels that correspond to the observed outcome of each sample. Splitting, folding, randomizing, sorting, and subsampling are all done while keeping the indices of samples and labels aligned. In addition to the basic Dataset interface, the Labeled class can sort and *stratify* the data by label.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|

```

Return *k* equal size subsets of the dataset:
```php
public stratifiedFold($k = 10) : array
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Datasets\Labeled;

// Import samples and labels

$dataset = Labeled::build($samples, $labels);  // Build a new dataset with validation

// or ...

$dataset = Labeled::quick($samples, $labels);  // Build a new dataset without validation

	}
});

// Return all the labels in the dataset
$labels = $dataset->labels();

// Return the label at offset 3
$label = $dataset->label(3);

// Return all possible unique labels
$outcomes = $dataset->possibleOutcomes();

var_dump($labels);
var_dump($label);
var_dump($outcomes);
```

### Meta-Estimators
Meta-estimators enhance base estimators by adding additional functionality such as [data preprocessing](#pipeline), [model persistence](#persistent-model), and [model averaging](#bootstrap-aggregator). Meta-estimators take on the type (*Classifier*, *Regressor*, etc.) of the base estimator they wrap and allow methods on the base estimator to be called from the parent.

### Bootstrap Aggregator
Bootstrap Aggregating (or *bagging* for short) is a model averaging technique designed to improve the stability and performance of a user-specified base estimator by training a number of them on a unique *bootstrapped* training set sampled at random with replacement. 

> **Note**: Bootstrap Aggregator does not work with clusterers or manifold learners.

##### Interfaces: Learner | Persistable
##### Compatibility: Variable

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | base | | object | The base estimator to be used in the ensemble. |
| 2 | estimators | 10 | int | The number of base estimators to train in the ensemble. |
| 3 | ratio | 0.5 | float | The ratio of samples from the training set to train each base estimator with. |

#### Additional Methods:
This meta estimator does not have any additional methods.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\BootstrapAggregator;
use Rubix\ML\Regressors\RegressionTree;

$estimator = new BootstrapAggregator(new RegressionTree(5), 100, 0.2);
```

### Grid Search
Grid Search is an algorithm that optimizes hyper-parameter selection. From the user's perspective, the process of training and predicting is the same, however, under the hood, Grid Search trains one estimator per combination of parameters and the best model is selected as the base estimator.

> **Note**: You can choose the parameters to search manually or you can generate them randomly or in a grid using the [Params](#params) helper.

##### Interfaces: Learner, Persistable, Verbose
##### Compatibility: Variable

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | base | | string | The fully qualified class name of the base Estimator. |
| 2 | grid | | array | An array of [n-tuples](#what-is-a-tuple) where each tuple contains possible parameters for a given constructor location by ordinal. |
| 3 | metric | Auto | object | The validation metric used to score each set of hyper-parameters. |
| 4 | validator | KFold | object | An instance of a validator object (HoldOut, KFold, etc.) that will be used to test each model. |
| 5 | retrain | true | bool | Should we retrain using the best parameter combination and entire dataset? |

#### Additional Methods:

Return every parameter combination from the last grid search:
```php
public params() : array
```

The validation scores of the last search:
```php
public scores() : array
```

A [tuple](#what-is-a-tuple) containing the best parameters and their validation score:
```php
public best() : array
```

Return the underlying base estimator:
```php
public estimator() : Estimator
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\GridSearch;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\KNearestNeighbors;
use Rubix\ML\Kernels\Distance\Euclidean;
use Rubix\ML\Kernels\Distance\Manhattan;
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\F1Score;
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\KFold;

$grid = [
	[1, 3, 5, 10], [new Euclidean(), new Manhattan()], [true, false],
];

$estimator = new GridSearch(KNearestNeightbors::class, $grid, new F1Score(), new KFold(10), true);
```

### Model Orchestra
A Model Orchestra is a stacked model ensemble comprised of an *orchestra* of estimators (Classifiers or Regressors) and a *conductor* estimator. The role of the conductor is to learn the influence scores of each estimator in the orchestra while using their predictions as inputs to make a final weighted prediction.

> **Note**: The features that each estimator passes on to the conductor may vary depending on the type of estimator. For example, a Probabilistic classifier will pass class probability scores while a regressor will pass on a single real value. If a datatype is not compatible with the conducting estimator, then wrap it in a [Pipeline](#pipeline) and use a transformer such as [One Hot Encoder](#one-hot-encoder) or [Interval Discretizer.](#interval-discretizer)

##### Interfaces: Learner, Probabilistic, Persistable, Verbose
##### Compatibility: Variable

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | orchestra | | array | The estimator instances that comprise the orchestra section of the ensemble. |
| 2 | conductor | | object | The estimator that will weight each prediction and give the final output. |
| 3 | ratio | 0.8 | float | The ratio of samples used to train the orchestra (the remaining are used to train the conductor).

#### Additional Methods:
Return an array of estimators comprising the orchestra part of the ensemble:
```php
public orchestra() : array
```

Return the conductor estimator:
```php
public conductor() : Estimator
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\ModelOrchestra;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\GaussianNB;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\KNearestNeighbors;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\ClassificationTree;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\SoftmaxClassifier;

$estimator = new ModelOrchestra([
	new ClassificationTree(10, 3, 2),
	new KNearestNeighbors(3, new Euclidean()),
	new GaussianNB(),
], new SoftmaxClassifier(10), 0.8);
```

### Persistent Model
It is possible to persist a model by wrapping the estimator instance in a Persistent Model meta-estimator. The Persistent Model wrapper gives the estimator three additional methods `save()`, `load()`, and `prompt()` that allow the estimator to be saved and retrieved from storage.

##### Interfaces: Learner, Probabilistic, Verbose
##### Compatibility: Variable

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | base | | object | An instance of the base estimator to be persisted. |
| 2 | persister | | object | The persister object used to store the model data. |

#### Additional Methods:
Save the persistent model to storage:
```php
public save() : void
```

Load the persistent model from storage given a persister:
```php
public static load(Persister $persister) : self
```

Prompt the user to save the model or not via stdout:
```php
public prompt() : void
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\PersistentModel;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\LogisticRegression;
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Optimizers\Adam;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Filesystem;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Serializers\Native;

$persister = new Filesystem('/random_forest.model', 2, new Native());

$estimator = new PersistentModel(new LogisticRegression(256, new Adam(0.001)), $persister);
```

### Pipeline
Pipeline is a meta estimator responsible for transforming the input data by applying a series of [transformer](#transformers) middleware. Pipeline accepts a base estimator and a list of transformers to apply to the input data before it is fed to the estimator. Under the hood, Pipeline will automatically fit the training set upon training and transform any [Dataset object](#dataset-objects) supplied as an argument to one of the base Estimator's methods, including `train()` and `predict()`. With the *elastic* mode enabled, Pipeline can update the fitting of certain transformers during online (*partial*) training.

> **Note**: Since transformations are applied to dataset objects in place (without making a copy), using the dataset in a program after it has been run through Pipeline may have unexpected results. If you need a *clean* dataset object to call multiple methods with, you can use the PHP clone syntax to keep an original (untransformed) copy in memory.

##### Interfaces: Learner, Online, Persistable, Verbose
##### Compatibility: Variable

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | transformers |  | array | The transformer middleware to be applied to the input data in order. |
| 2 | estimator |  | object | An instance of the base estimator to receive transformed data. |
| 3 | elastic | true | bool | Should we update the elastic transformers during partial training? |

#### Additional Methods:
This meta estimator does not have any additional methods.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Pipeline;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\SoftmaxClassifier;
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Optimizer\Adam;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\MissingDataImputer;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\OneHotEncoder;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\PrincipalComponentAnalysis;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\ZScaleStandardizer;

$estimator = new Pipeline([
	new MissingDataImputer('?'),
	new OneHotEncoder(),
	new PrincipalComponentAnalysis(20),
	new ZScaleStandardizer(true),
], new SoftmaxClassifier(128, new Adam(0.001)), true);
```

### Estimators
Estimators consist of various [Classifiers](#classifiers), [Regressors](#regressors), [Clusterers](#clusterers), [Embedders](#embedders), and [Anomaly Detectors](#anomaly-detectors) that make *predictions* based on their training. Estimators that can be trained using data are called *Learners* and they can either be supervised or unsupervised depending on the task. Estimators can employ methods on top of the basic API by implementing a number of addon interfaces such as [Online](#online), [Probabilistic](#probabilistic), [Persistable](#persistable), and [Verbose](#verbose). The most basic Estimator is one that outputs an array of predictions given a dataset of unknown or testing samples.

To make predictions, pass the estimator a dataset object filled with samples you'd like to predict:
```php
public predict(Dataset $dataset) : array
```

> **Note**: The return value of `predict()` is an array containing the predictions indexed in the same order that they were fed into the estimator.

### Learner
Most estimators have the ability to be trained with data. These estimators are called *Learners* and require training before they are able make predictions. Training is the process of feeding data to the learner so that it can formulate a generalized function that maps future samples to good predictions.

To train an learner pass it a training dataset:
```php
public train(Dataset $training) : void
```

Return whether or not the learner has been trained:
```php
public trained() : bool
```

#### Example:
```php
$estimator->train($dataset);
```

> **Note**: Calling `train()` on an already trained estimator will cause any previous training to be lost. If you would like to be able to train a model incrementally, see the [Online](#online) Estimator interface.

### Online
Certain estimators that implement the *Online* interface can be trained in batches. Estimators of this type are great for when you either have a continuous stream of data or a dataset that is too large to fit into memory. Partial training allows the model to evolve as new information about the world is acquired.

You can partially train an online estimator by:
```php
public partial(Dataset $dataset) : void
```

#### Example:
```php
$folds = $dataset->fold(3);

$estimator->train($folds[0]);

$estimator->partial($folds[1]);

$estimator->partial($folds[2]);
```

> **Note**: an Estimator will continue to train as long as you are using the `partial()` method, however, calling `train()` on a trained or partially trained Estimator will reset it back to baseline first.

---
### Probabilistic
Estimators that implement the *Probabilistic* interface have an additional method that returns an array of probability scores of each possible class, cluster, etc. Probabilities are useful for ascertaining the degree to which the estimator is certain about a particular prediction.

Return the probability estimates of a prediction:
```php
public proba(Dataset $dataset) : array
```

#### Example:
```php
$probabilities = $estimator->proba($dataset);  

var_dump($probabilities);
```

#### Output:
```sh
array(2) {
	[0] => array(2) {
		['married'] => 0.975,
		['divorced'] => 0.025,
	}
	[1] => array(2) {
		['married'] => 0.200,
		['divorced'] => 0.800,
	}
}
```

### Verbose
Verbose estimators are capable of logging errors and important training events to any PSR-3 compatible logger such as [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog), [Analog](https://github.com/jbroadway/analog), or the included [Screen Logger](#screen). Logging is especially useful for monitoring the progress of the underlying learning algorithm in real time.

To set the logger pass in any PSR-3 compatible logger instance:
```php
public setLogger(LoggerInterface $logger) : void
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Other\Loggers\Screen;

$estimator->setLogger(new Screen('sentiment'));
```

---
### Anomaly Detectors
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying samples that do not conform to an expected pattern. The output prediction of a detector is a binary encoding (either *0* for a normal sample or *1* for a detected anomaly).

### Isolation Forest

use Rubix\ML\AnomalyDetection\LocalOutlierFactor;
use Rubix\ML\Kernels\Distance\Minkowski;

$estimator = new LocalOutlierFactor(20, 0.1, new Minkowski(3.5));
```

### One Class SVM
An unsupervised Support Vector Machine used for anomaly detection. The One Class SVM aims to find a maximum margin between a set of data points and the *origin*, rather than between classes such as with  multiclass SVM ([SVC](#svc)).

> **Note**: This estimator requires the [SVM PHP extension](https://php.net/manual/en/book.svm.php) which uses the LIBSVM engine written in C++ under the hood.

use Rubix\ML\Kernels\SVM\Polynomial;

$estimator = new OneClassSVM(0.1, new Polynomial(4), true, 1e-3, 100.);
```

### Robust Z Score
A quick *global* anomaly detector that uses a modified Z score which is robust to outliers to detect anomalies within a dataset. The modified Z score consists of taking the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of the mean and standard deviation (*standard* Z score) thus making the statistic more robust to training sets that may already contain outliers. Outliers can be flagged in one of two ways. First, their average Z score can be above the user-defined tolerance level or an individual feature's score could be above the threshold (*hard* limit).

##### Interfaces: Learner, Persistable
##### Compatibility: Continuous

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | tolerance | 3.0 | float | The average z score to tolerate before a sample is considered an outlier. |
| 2 | threshold | 3.5 | float | The threshold z score of a individual feature to consider the entire sample an outlier. |

Return the median of each feature column in the training set:
```php
public medians() : ?array
```

Return the median absolute deviation (MAD) of each feature column in the training set:
```php
public mads() : ?array
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\AnomalyDetection\RobustZScore;

$estimator = new RobustZScore(1.5, 3.0);
```

An *Extremely Randomized* Classification Tree - these trees differ from standard [Classification Trees](#classification-tree) in that they choose the best split drawn from a random set determined by *max features*, rather than searching the entire column. Extra Trees work well in ensembles such as [Random Forest](#random-forest) or [AdaBoost](#adaboost) as the *weak learner* or they can be used on their own. The strength of Extra Trees are computational efficiency as well as increasing variance of the prediction (if that is desired).

### MLP Regressor
A multi layer feedforward [Neural Network](#neural-network) with a continuous output layer suitable for regression problems. Like the [Multi Layer Perceptron](#multi-layer-perceptron) classifier, the MLP Regressor is able to tackle deep learning problems by forming higher-order representations of the features using intermediate computational units called *hidden* layers.

> **Note**: The MLP features progress monitoring which stops training early if it can no longer make progress. It also utilizes snapshotting to make sure that it always has the best settings of the model parameters even if progress began to decline during training.

Similarly to the [Support Vector Machine Classifier](#svc), the model produced by SVR (*R* for regression) depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction given by parameter *epsilon*. Thus, the value of epsilon defines a margin of tolerance where no penalty is given to errors.

### Transformers
Transformers take dataset objects and transform them in various ways. Examples of transformations that can be applied are scaling and centering, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and imputation.

The transformer directly transforms the data in place via the `transform()` method:
```php
public transform(array &$samples, ?array &$labels = null) : void
```

> **Note**: To transform a dataset without having to pass the raw samples and labels you can pass a transformer to the `apply()` method on a Dataset object.

### Stateful
For stateful transformers, the `fit()` method will allow the transformer to compute any necessary information from the training set in order to carry out its future transformations. You can think of *fitting* a transformer like *training* a learner.

To fit the transformer to a training set:
```php
public fit(Dataset $dataset) : void
```

Check if the transformer has been fitted:
```php
public fitted() : bool
```

#### Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\OneHotEncoder;

$transformer = new OneHotEncoder();

$transformer->fit($dataset);
```

### Elastic
Some transformers are able to adapt to new training data. The `update()` method on transformers that implement the Elastic interface can be used to modify the fitting of the transformer with new data even after it has previously been fitted. *Updating* is to transformer as *partially training* is to online learner.

```php
public update(Dataset $dataset) : void
```

#### Example
```php
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\ZScaleStandardizer;

$transformer = new ZScaleStandardizer();

$folds = $dataset->fold(3);

$transformer->fit($folds[0]);

$transformer->update($folds[1]);

$transformer->update($folds[2]);
```

### Gaussian Random Projector
A random projector is a dimensionality reducer based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma that uses a random matrix to project feature vectors onto a user-specified number of dimensions.

### Neural Network
A number of estimators in Rubix are implemented as a Neural Network under the hood. Neural nets are trained using an iterative supervised learning process called Gradient Descent with Backpropagation that repeatedly takes small steps towards minimizing a user-defined cost function. Networks can have an arbitrary number of intermediate computational layers called *hidden* layers. Hidden layers can perform a number of different functions including higher order feature detection, non-linear activation, normalization, and regularization.

### Activation Functions
The input to a node in the network is often passed through an Activation Function (sometimes referred to as a *transfer* function) which determines its output behavior. In the context of a *biologically inspired* neural network, the activation function is an abstraction representing the rate of action potential firing of a neuron.

Activation Functions can be broken down into three classes - Sigmoidal (or *S* shaped) such as [Hyperbolic Tangent](#hyperbolic-tangent), Rectifiers such as [ELU](#elu) and LeakyReLU(#leaky-relu), and Radial Basis Functions (*RBFs*) such as [Gaussian](#gaussian).

### ELU
*Exponential Linear Units* are a type of rectifier that soften the transition from non-activated to activated using the exponential function.

##### Rectifier

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | alpha | 1.0 | float | The value at which leakage will begin to saturate. Ex. alpha = 1.0 means that the output will never be less than -1.0 when inactivated. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\ActivationFunctions\ELU;

$activationFunction = new ELU(5.0);
```

### Gaussian
The Gaussian activation function is a type of Radial Basis Function (*RBF*) whose activation depends only on the distance the input is from the origin.

##### Radial

#### Parameters:
This activation Function does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\ActivationFunctions\Gaussian;

$activationFunction = new Gaussian();
```

### Hyperbolic Tangent
S-shaped function that squeezes the input value into an output space between -1 and 1 centered at 0.

##### Sigmoidal

#### Parameters:
This activation Function does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\ActivationFunctions\HyperbolicTangent;

$activationFunction = new HyperbolicTangent();
```

### ISRU
Inverse Square Root units have a curve similar to [Hyperbolic Tangent](#hyperbolic-tangent) and [Sigmoid](#sigmoid) but use the inverse of the square root function instead. It is purported by the authors to be computationally less complex than either of the aforementioned. In addition, ISRU allows the parameter alpha to control the range of activation such that it equals + or - 1 / sqrt(alpha).

##### Sigmoidal

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | alpha | 1.0 | float | The parameter that controls the range of activation. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\ActivationFunctions\ISRU;

$activationFunction = new ISRU(2.0);
```

### Leaky ReLU
Leaky Rectified Linear Units are activation functions that output x when x > 0 or a small leakage value determined as the input times the leakage coefficient when x < 0. The amount of leakage is controlled by the *leakage* parameter.

##### Rectifier

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | leakage | 0.1 | float | The amount of leakage as a ratio of the input value. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\ActivationFunctions\LeakyReLU;

$activationFunction = new LeakyReLU(0.3);
```

### ReLU
Rectified Linear Units output only the positive part of the inputs.

> **Note**: ReLUs are analogous to half-wave rectifiers in electrical engineering.

##### Retifier

#### Parameters:
This activation Function does not have any parameters.

### Cost Functions
In neural networks, the cost function is a function that the network tries to minimize during training. The cost of a particular activation is defined as the difference between the output of the network and what the correct output should be given the ground truth label. Different cost functions have different ways of punishing erroneous activations and thus produce differently shaped gradients when backpropagated.

### Cross Entropy
Cross Entropy, or *log loss*, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .012 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. A perfect score would have a log loss of 0.

#### Parameters:
This cost function does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\CostFunctions\CrossEntropy;

$costFunction = new CrossEntropy();
```

### Exponential
This cost function calculates the exponential of a prediction's squared error thus applying a large penalty to wrong predictions. The resulting gradient of the Exponential loss tends to be steeper than most other cost functions. The magnitude of the error can be scaled by the parameter *tau*.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | tau | 1.0 | float | The scaling parameter i.e. the magnitude of the error to return. |

```

### Huber Loss
The *pseudo* Huber Loss function transitions between L1 and L2 (Least Squares) loss at a given pivot point (*delta*) such that the function becomes more quadratic as the loss decreases. The combination of L1 and L2 loss makes Huber Loss robust to outliers while maintaining smoothness near the minimum.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | delta | 1. | float | The pivot point i.e the point where numbers larger will be evaluated with an L1 loss while number smaller will be evaluated with an L2 loss. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\CostFunctions\HuberLoss;

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Initializers\He;

$initializer = new He();
```

### Layers
Every neural network is made up of layers of computational units called neurons. Each layer processes and transforms the input from the previous layer in such a way that makes it easier for the next layer to form high-level abstractions.

There are three types of layers that form a network, **Input**, **Hidden**, and **Output**. A network can have as many Hidden layers as the user specifies, however, there can only be 1 Input and 1 Output layer per network.

### Input Layers
The entry point for data into a neural network is the input layer which is the first layer in the network. Input layers do not have any learnable parameters.

### Placeholder 1D
The Placeholder 1D input layer represents the *future* input values of a mini batch (matrix) of single dimensional tensors (vectors) to the neural network.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | inputs | None | int | The number of inputs to the neural network. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Layers\Placeholder1D;

$layer = new Placeholder1D(100);
```

### Hidden Layers
In multilayer networks, hidden layers are responsible for transforming the input space in such a way that can be linearly separable by the final output layer.

### Alpha Dropout
Alpha Dropout is a type of dropout layer that maintains the mean and variance of the original inputs in order to ensure the self-normalizing property of [SELU](#selu) networks with dropout. Alpha Dropout fits with SELU networks by randomly setting activations to the negative saturation value of the activation function at a given ratio each pass.

> **Note**: Alpha Dropout is generally only used in the context of SELU networks. Use regular [Dropout](#dropout) for other types of neural nets.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |

$layer = new AlphaDropout(0.1);
```

### Batch Norm
Normalize the activations of the previous layer such that the mean activation is close to 0 and the activation standard deviation is close to 1. Batch Norm can be used to reduce the amount of *covariate shift* within the network making it possible to use higher learning rates and converge faster under some circumstances.

#### Parameters:
This layer does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Layers\BatchNorm;

$layer = new BatchNorm();
```

In addition to storing an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients like [RMSprop](#rms-prop), Adam also keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients, similar to [Momentum](#momentum). Whereas Momentum can be seen as a ball running down a slope, Adam behaves like a heavy ball with friction, which thus prefers flat minima in the error surface.

| 1 | lower | 0.001 | float | The lower bound on the learning rate. |
| 2 | upper | 0.006 | float | The upper bound on the learning rate. |

```php
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Optimizers\RMSProp;

$optimizer = new RMSProp(0.01, 0.9);
```

### Step Decay
A learning rate decay optimizer that reduces the learning rate by a factor of the decay parameter whenever it reaches a new *floor*. The number of steps needed to reach a new floor is defined by the *steps* parameter.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | rate | 0.01 | float | The learning rate. i.e. the master step size. |

### Kernels

### Distance
Distance functions are a type of kernel that measure the distance between two coordinate vectors. They are used throughout Rubix in Estimators that employ the concept of *distance* to make predictions such as [K Nearest Neighbors](#k-nearest-neighbors), [K Means](#k-means), and [Local Outlier Factor](#local-outlier-factor).

### Canberra

```

### Cosine
Cosine Similarity is a measure that ignores the magnitude of the distance between two vectors thus acting as strictly a judgement of orientation. Two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90° relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1. To be used as a distance function, we subtract the Cosine Similarity from 1 in order to satisfy the positive semi-definite condition, therefore the Cosine *distance* is a number between 0 and 2.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Kernels\Distance\Cosine;

$kernel = new Cosine();

### Minkowski
The Minkowski distance is a metric in a normed vector space which can be considered as a generalization of both the [Euclidean](#euclidean) and [Manhattan](#manhattan) distances. When the *lambda* parameter is set to 1 or 2, the distance is equivalent to Manhattan and Euclidean respectively.

### Cross Validation
Cross validation is the process of testing the generalization performance of a model.

### Validators
Validators take an [Estimator](#estimators) instance, [Labeled Dataset](#labeled) object, and validation [Metric](#validation-metrics) and return a validation score that measures the generalization performance of the model using one of various cross validation techniques. There is no need to train the Estimator beforehand as the Validator will automatically train it on subsets of the dataset created by the testing algorithm.

```php
public test(Estimator $estimator, Labeled $dataset, Validation $metric) : float
```

Return the validation scores computed at last test time:
```php
public scores() : ?array
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\KFold;
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\Accuracy;

...
$validator = new KFold(10);

$score = $validator->test($estimator, $dataset, new Accuracy());

var_dump($score);
```

#### Output:
```sh
float(0.869)
```

### Hold Out
Hold Out is a simple cross validation technique that uses a *hold out* validation set. The advantages of Hold Out is that it is quick, but it doesn't allow the model to train on the entire training set.

|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | ratio | 0.2 | float | The ratio of samples to hold out for testing. |

```

### K Fold
K Fold is a technique that splits the training set into K individual sets and for each training round uses 1 of the folds to measure the validation performance of the model.

### Validation Metrics
Validation metrics are for evaluating the performance of an Estimator given the ground truth labels.

Compute a validation score, pass in the predictions from an estimator along with the ground-truth labels:
```php
public score(array $predictions, array $labels) : float
```

Output the range of values the validation score can take on in a 2-tuple:
```php
public range() : array
```

Return a list of estimators that metric is compatible with:
```php
public compatibility() : array
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\MeanAbsoluteError;

...
$metric = new MeanAbsoluteError();

$score = $metric->score($predictions, $labels);

var_dump($metric->range());

var_dump($score);
```

#### Output:
```sh
array(2) {
  [0]=> float(-INF)
  [1]=> int(0)
}

float(-0.99846070553066)
```

### Accuracy
Accuracy is a quick classification and anomaly detection metric defined as the number of true positives over all samples in the testing set.

##### Compatibility: Clustering

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\Completeness;

$metric = new Completeness();
```

### F1 Score
A weighted average of precision and recall with equal relative contribution.

### Homogeneity
A ground truth clustering metric that measures the ratio of samples in a cluster that are also members of the same class. A cluster is said to be *homogeneous* when the entire cluster is comprised of a single class of samples.

##### Compatibility: Clustering

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\Homogeneity;

$metric = new Homogeneity();
```

### Informedness
Informedness is a measure of the probability that an estimator will make an informed decision. The index was suggested by W.J. Youden as a way of summarizing the performance of a diagnostic test. Its value ranges from 0 through 1 and has a zero value when the test gives the same proportion of positive results for groups with and without the disease, i.e the test is useless.

##### Compatibility: Classification, Anomaly Detection

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\Informedness;

$metric = new Informedness();
```

### MCC
Matthews Correlation Coefficient measures the quality of a classification. It takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between −1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and −1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.p

##### Compatibility: Classification, Anomaly Detection

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\MCC;

$metric = new MCC();
```

### Mean Absolute Error
A metric that measures the average amount that a prediction is off by given some ground truth (labels).

##### Compatibility: Regression

```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\MeanAbsoluteError;

$metric = new MeanAbsoluteError();
```

### Mean Squared Error

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\MeanSquaredError;

$metric = new MeanSquaredError();
```

### Median Absolute Error
Median Absolute Error (MAE) is a robust measure of the error that ignores highly erroneous predictions.

##### Compatibility: Regression

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\MedianAbsoluteError;

$metric = new MedianAbsoluteError();
```

### RMS Error

##### Compatibility: Regression

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\RMSError;

$metric = new RMSError();
```

### R Squared
The *coefficient of determination* or R Squared (R²) is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

##### Compatibility: Regression

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\RSquared;

$metric = new RSquared();
```

### V Measure
V Measure is the harmonic balance between [homogeneity](#homogeneity) and [completeness](#completeness) and is used as a measure to determine the quality of a clustering.

##### Compatibility: Clustering

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Metrics\VMeasure;

$metric = new VMeasure();
```

### Other
This section includes all classes that do not fall under a specific category.

### Guessing Strategies
Guesses can be thought of as a type of *weak* prediction. Unlike a real prediction, guesses are made using limited information. A guessing Strategy attempts to use such information to formulate an educated guess. Guessing is utilized in both Dummy Estimators ([Dummy Classifier](#dummy-classifier), [Dummy Regressor](#dummy-regressor)) as well as the [Missing Data Imputer](#missing-data-imputer).

The Strategy interface provides an API similar to Transformers as far as fitting, however, instead of being fit to an entire dataset, each Strategy is fit to an array of either continuous or discrete values.

To fit a Strategy to an array of values:
```php
public fit(array $values) : void
```

To make a guess based on the fitted data:
```php
public guess() : mixed
```

```php
use Rubix\ML\Other\Strategies\BlurryPercentile;

$strategy = new BlurryPercentile(34.0, 0.2);
```

### Constant

| 5 | password | | string | An optional password to access the database server. |
| 6 | history | 2 | int | The number of backups to keep. |
| 7 | serializer | Native | object | The serializer used to convert to and from serial format. |
| 8 | timeout | 2.5 | float | The time in seconds to wait for a response from the server before timing out. |

#### Additional Methods:
Return an associative array of info from the Redis server:
```php
public info() : array
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\RedisDB;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Serializers\Native;

$persister = new RedisDB('model:sentiment', '127.0.0.1', 6379, 2, 'secret', 5, new Native(), 1.5);
```

### Serializers
Serializers take persistable objects and convert between object and serial (text, binary, etc.) representations of them. They are responsible for making persistable objects savable to a backend system such as a database or filesystem.

To serialize a persistable object:
```php
public serialize(Persistable $persistable) : string
```

To unserialize a persistable object:
```php
public unserialize(string $data) : Persistable
```

### Binary Serializer
Converts persistable object to and from a binary encoding. Binary format is *usually* smaller and faster than plain text serializers.

#### Parameters:
This serializer does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Serializers\Binary;

$serializer = new Binary();
```

### Native
The native PHP plain text serialization format used to encode persistable objects.

#### Parameters:
This serializer does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Serializers\Native;

$serializer = new Native();
```

---
### Tokenizers
Tokenizers take a body of text and convert the words to an array of string *tokens*. Tokens can represent a single word or multiple words such as in [NGram](#n-gram) and [SkipGram](#skip-gram). Tokenizers are used by various transformers in Rubix such as the [Word Count Vectorizer](#word-count-vectorizer) to represent blobs of text as token counts.

To tokenize a blob of text:
```php
public tokenize(string $text) : array
```

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Extractors\Tokenizers\Word;

$text = 'I would like to die on Mars, just not on impact.';

$tokenizer = new Word();

var_dump($tokenizer->tokenize($text));
```

#### Output:
```sh
  array(10) {
    [0]=> string(5) "would"
	[1]=> string(4) "like"
	[2]=> string(2) "to"
	[3]=> string(3) "die"
	[4]=> string(2) "on"
	[5]=> string(4) "Mars"
	[6]=> string(4) "just"
	[7]=> string(3) "not"
	[8]=> string(2) "on"
	[9]=> string(6) "impact"
  }
```

### N-Gram
N-Grams are sequences of n-words of a given string where n is a user-defined parameter. For example, if *n* is 2 then the tokenizer will generate tokens consisting of 2 contiguous words.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | n | 2 | int | The number of contiguous words to a single token. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Extractors\Tokenizers\NGram;

$tokenizer = new NGram(3);
```

### Skip-Gram
Skip-grams are a technique similar to n-grams, whereby n-grams are formed but in addition to allowing adjacent sequences of words, the next *k* words will be *skipped* forming n-grams of the new forward looking sequences.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | n | 2 | int | The number of contiguous words to a single token. |
| 2 | skip | 2 | int | The number of words to skip over to form new n-gram sequences. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Extractors\Tokenizers\SkipGram;

$tokenizer = new SkipGram(2, 2);
```

### Whitespace
Tokens are delimited by a user-specified whitespace character.

#### Parameters:
| # | Param | Default | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | delimiter | ' ' | string | The whitespace character that delimits each token. |

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Extractors\Tokenizers\Whitespace;

$tokenizer = new Whitespace(',');
```

### Word Tokenizer
The Word tokenizer uses a regular expression to tokenize the words in a blob of text.

#### Parameters:
This tokenizer does not have any parameters.

#### Example:
```php
use Rubix\ML\Extractors\Tokenizers\Word;

$tokenizer = new Word();
```

## FAQ
Here you can find answers to the most frequently asked Rubix ML questions.

### What environment should I run Rubix in?
All Rubix programs are designed to run from the PHP [command line interface](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php) (CLI). The reason almost always boils down to performance.

If you want to serve your trained estimators in production then you can use the [Rubix Server](https://github.com/RubixML/Server) library to run a standalone model server that implements its own networking (HTTP, TCP, ZMQ, etc.) layer and runs from the CLI instead of Apache server or NGINX via FPM which is much slower.

To run a program using the command line interface (CLI), open a terminal and enter:
```sh
$ php example.php
```

> **Note**: The PHP interpreter must be in your default PATH for the above syntax to work.

### What is a Tuple?
A *tuple* is simply a way to denote an immutable sequential array with a predefined length. An *n-tuple* is a tuple with the length of n. In other languages, such as Python, tuples are a separate datatype and their properties such as immutability are enforced by the interpreter, unlike PHP arrays.

#### Example:
```php
$tuple = ['first', 'second', 0.001]; // a 3-tuple
```

### Does Rubix support multithreading?
Not currently, however we do plan to add CPU and GPU multithreading in the future.

### Does Rubix support Deep Learning?
Yes. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves forming higher-order representations of the input data such as edges and textures in an image. A number of learners in Rubix support Deep *Representation* Learning including the [Multi Layer Perceptron](#multi-layer-perceptron) classifier and [MLP Regressor](#mlp-regressor).

### What is the difference between categorical and continuous data types?
There are 2 classes of data types that Rubix distinguishes by convention.

Categorical (or *discrete*) data are those that describe a *qualitative* property of a sample such as *color* or *city* and can be 1 of K possible values. Categorical features are denoted as *string* types.

Continuous data are *quantitative* properties of sample such as *height* or *age* and can be any number within the set of infinite *real* numbers. Continuous features are represented as either *float* or *int* types.

### Does Rubix support Reinforcement Learning?
We do not. Rubix is only designed for *supervised* and *unsupervised* learning.

### I'm getting out of memory errors
Try adjusting the `memory_limit` option in your php.ini file to something more reasonable. We recommend setting this to *-1* (no limit) unless you are running in production.

> **Note**: Machine Learning can sometimes require a lot of memory. The amount necessary will depend on the amount of training data and the size of your model. If you have more data than you can hold in memory, some learners allow you to train in batches. See [Online](#online) estimators for more information.

## Testing
Rubix utilizes a combination of static code analysis and unit tests for quality assurance and to reduce the number of bugs. Rubix provides three [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) scripts that can be run from the root directory to automate the testing process.

To run static analysis:
```sh
$ composer analyze
```

To run the style checker:
```sh
$ composer check
```

To run the unit tests:
```sh
$ composer test
```

> **Note**: Due to the non-deterministic nature of many of the learning algorithms, it is normal for some tests to fail intermittently.
