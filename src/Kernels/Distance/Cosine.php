 * Cosine
 *
 * Cosine Similarity is a measure that ignores the magnitude of the distance
 * between two vectors thus acting as strictly a judgement of orientation. Two
 * vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors
 * oriented at 90° relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two
 * vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1. To be used as a
 * distance kernel, we subtract the Cosine Similarity from 1 in order to
 * satisfy the positive semi-definite condition, therefore the Cosine distance
 * is a number between 0 and 2.
