We assume that you already have a basic understanding of the different types of machine learning such as classification and regression. If not, we recommend the section on What is Machine Learning? to start with. Obtaining Data # Machine learning (ML) projects typically begin with a question. For example, you might want to answer the question of \"who of my friends are most likely to stay married to their partner?\" One way to go about answering this question with machine learning would be to go out and ask a bunch of happily married and divorced couples the same set of questions about their partner and then use the answers they gave you to build a model to predict successful relationships. In machine learning terms, the answers you collect are the values of the features that constitute measurements of the phenomena being observed - in this case, the response to a question. The number of features in a sample is called the dimensionality of the sample. For example, a sample with 10 features is said to be 10-dimensional . Suppose that you went out and asked 4 couples (2 married and 2 divorced) to respond to 3 features - their partner's communication skills (between 1 and 5), attractiveness (between 1 and 5), and time spent together per week (hours per week). You would structure the data in PHP like in the example below. You'll notice that the samples are represented in a 2-d array (or matrix ) and the labels are represented as a 1-d array. $samples = [ [ 3 , 4 , 50.5 ], [ 1 , 5 , 24.7 ], [ 4 , 4 , 62.0 ], [ 3 , 2 , 31.1 ], ]; $labels = [ 'married' , 'divorced' , 'married' , 'divorced' ]; Note See the Representing your Data section for an in-depth description of how the library treats various forms of data. The Dataset Object # In Rubix ML, data are passed in specialized containers called Dataset objects . Dataset objects handle selecting, subsampling, splitting, randomizing, and sorting of the samples and labels contained within. In general, there are two types of datasets, Labeled and Unlabeled . Labeled datasets are used for supervised learning and for providing the ground-truth during testing. Unlabeled datasets are used for unsupervised learning and for making predictions. You could construct a Labeled dataset from the data we collected earlier by passing the samples and their labels into the constructor like in the example below. use Rubix\\ML\\Datasets\\Labeled ; $dataset = new Labeled ( $samples , $labels ); Note See the Extracting Data section to learn more about extracting data from different formats and storage mediums. Choosing an Estimator # Estimators make up the core of the Rubix ML library. They provide the predict() API and are responsible for making predictions on unknown samples. Estimators that can be trained with data are called Learners and must be trained before making predictions. In practice, one will experiment with a number of estimators to find the one that works best for their dataset. For our example, we'll focus on an intuitable distance-based supervised learner called K Nearest Neighbors . KNN is a classifier because it takes unknown samples and assigns them a class label. In our example, the output of KNN will either be married or divorced since those are the class labels that we'll train it with. Like most estimators in Rubix, the K Nearest Neighbors classifier requires a set of parameters (called hyper-parameters ) to be chosen up-front by the user. These parameters are defined in the class's constructor and control how the learner behaves during training and inference. Hyper-parameters can be selected based on some prior knowledge or completely at random. The defaults provided are a good place to start for most problems. K Nearest Neighbors works by locating the closest training samples to an unknown sample and choosing the class label that is most common. The hyper-parameter k is the number of nearest points from the training set to compare an unknown sample to in order to infer its class label. For example, if the 3 closest neighbors to a given unknown sample have 2 married and 1 divorced label, then the algorithm will output a prediction of married since its the most common. To instantiate the learner, pass a set of hyper-parameters to the class's constructor. For this example, let's set k to 3 and leave the rest of the hyper-parameters as their default. use Rubix\\ML\\Classifiers\\KNearestNeighbors ; $estimator = new KNearestNeighbors ( 3 ); Note See the Choosing an Estimator section for an in-depth look at the estimators available to you in the library. Training # Training is the process of feeding the learning algorithm data so that it can build an internal representation (or model ) of the task its trying to learn. This representation consists of all of the parameters (except hyper-parameters) that are required to make a prediction. To start training, pass the training dataset as a argument to the train() method on the learner instance. $estimator -> train ( $dataset ); We can verify that the learner has been trained by calling the trained() method. var_dump ( $estimator -> trained ()); bool ( true ) For our small training set, the training process should only take a matter of microseconds, but larger datasets with more features can take longer. Now that the learner is trained, in the next section we'll show how we can feed in unknown samples to generate predictions. Note See the Training section of the docs for a closer look at training a learner. Making Predictions # Suppose that we went out and collected 4 new data points from different friends using the same questions we asked the couples we interviewed for our training set. We could predict whether or not they will stay married to their spouse by taking their answers and passing them in an Unlabeled dataset to the predict() method on our newly trained estimator. This process of making predictions is called inference because the estimator uses the model constructed during training to infer the label of the unknown samples. Note If you attempt to make predictions using an untrained learner, it will throw an exception. use Rubix\\ML\\Datasets\\Unlabeled ; $samples = [ [ 4 , 3 , 44.2 ], [ 2 , 2 , 16.7 ], [ 2 , 4 , 19.5 ], [ 3 , 3 , 55.0 ], ]; $dataset = new Unlabeled ( $samples ); $predictions = $estimator -> predict ( $dataset ); var_dump ( $predictions ); array ( 4 ) { [ 0 ] = > 'married' [ 1 ] = > 'divorced' [ 2 ] = > 'divorced' [ 4 ] = > 'married' } The output of the estimator are the predicted class labels of the unknown samples. We could either trust these predictions as-is or we could proceed to further evaluate the model. In the next section, we'll learn how to test its accuracy using a process called cross validation. Note Check out the section on Inference for more info on making predictions. Model Evaluation # Let's imagine we went out and collected enough data from our married and divorced friends to build a dataset consisting of 50 samples with their corresponding labels. We could use the entire dataset to train the learner or we could set some of the data aside to use for testing. By setting some data aside we are able to test the model on data it has never seen before. This technique is referred to as cross validation and its goal is to test an estimator's ability to generalize its training. For the purposes of the introduction, we'll use a simple Hold Out validator which takes a portion of the dataset for testing and leaves the rest for training. The Hold Out validator requires the user to set the ratio of testing to training samples as a constructor parameter. Let's choose to use a factor of 0.2 (20%) of the dataset for testing leaving the rest (80%) for training. Note 20% is a good default choice however your mileage may vary. The important thing to note here is the trade off between more data for training and more data to produce better testing results. use Rubix\\ML\\CrossValidation\\HoldOut ; $validator = new HoldOut ( 0.2 ); The test() method on the validator requires a compatible validation Metric to be chosen as the scoring function. One classification metric we could use is the Accuracy metric which is defined as the number of true positives over the total number of predictions. For example, if the estimator returned 10 out of 10 correct predictions then its accuracy would be 1. To return a score from the Hold Out validator using the Accuracy metric, pass an estimator instance along with the samples and their ground-truth labels in a dataset object to the validator like in the example below. use Rubix\\ML\\Datasets\\Labeled ; use Rubix\\ML\\CrossValidation\\Metrics\\Accuracy ; $dataset = new Labeled ( $samples , $labels ); $score = $validator -> test ( $estimator , $dataset , new Accuracy ()); echo $score ; 0.88 The return value is the accuracy score which can be interpreted as the degree to which the learner is able to correctly generalize its training to unseen data. According to the example above, our model is 88% accurate. Nice work! Note More info can be found in the Cross Validation section of the docs. Next Steps # Congratulations!

Flexibility can be expressed in different ways but greater flexibility usually comes with the capacity to handle more complex tasks. The tradeoff for flexibility is increased computational complexity, reduced model interpretability, and greater susceptibility to overfitting . In contrast, low flexibility models tend to be easier to interpret and quicker to train but are more prone to underfitting . In general, we recommend choosing the simplest model that does not underfit the training data for your project. Meta-estimator Ensembles # Ensemble learning is when multiple estimators are used together to make the final prediction of a sample. Meta-estimator ensembles can consist of multiple variations of the same estimator or a heterogeneous mix of estimators of the same type. They generally work by the principal of averaging and can often achieve greater accuracy than a single estimator at the cost of training more models. Bootstrap Aggregator # Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging is an ensemble learning technique that trains a set of learners that each specialize on a unique subset of the training set known as a bootstrap set. The final prediction made by the meta-estimator is the averaged prediction returned by the ensemble. In the example below, we'll wrap a Regression Tree in a Bootstrap Aggregator to form a forest of 1000 trees. use Rubix\\ML\\BootstrapAggregator ; use Rubix\\ML\\Regressors\\RegressionTree ; $estimator = new BootstrapAggregator ( new RegressionTree ( 5 ), 1000 ); Committee Machine # Committee Machine is a voting ensemble consisting of estimators (referred to as experts ) with user-programmable influences .

Perhaps a more useful way of stating NFL is that certain learners perform better at certain tasks and worse in others. This is explained by the fact that all learning algorithms have some prior knowledge inherent in them whether it be via the choice of hyper-parameters or the design of the algorithm itself. Another consequence of No Free Lunch is that there exists no single estimator that performs better for all problems.","title":"Choosing an Estimator"},{"location":"choosing-an-estimator.html#choosing-an-estimator","text":"Estimators make up the core of the Rubix ML library and include classifiers, regressors, clusterers, anomaly detectors, and meta-estimators organized into their own namespaces.

Underfitting # A poorly performing model can sometimes be explained as underfitting the training data - a condition in which the learner is unable to capture the underlying pattern or trend given the model constraints. The result of an underfit model is an estimator with high bias error. Underfitting usually occurs when a simple model is chosen to represent data that is complex and non-linear. Adding more features to the dataset can help, however if the problem is too severe, a more flexible learning algorithm can be chosen for the task instead. Overfitting # When a model performs well on training data but poorly during cross-validation it could be that the model has overfit the training data. Overfitting occurs when the model conforms too closely to the training data and therefore fails to generalize well to new data or make predictions reliably. Flexible models are more prone to overfitting due to their ability to memorize individual samples. Most learners employ strategies such as regularization, early stopping, and/or tree pruning to control overfitting, however if overfitting is still a problem, adding more samples to the dataset can also help. Selection Bias # When a model performs well on certain samples but poorly on others it could be that the learner was trained with a dataset that exhibits selection bias. Selection bias is the bias introduced when a population is disproportionally represented in a dataset. For example, if a learner is trained to classify pictures of cats and dogs but mostly (say 90%) cats are represented in the dataset, the model will likely have difficulty making real-world predictions where cats and dogs are more equally represented. To correct selection bias, either obtain more training samples or up-sample the class of the underrepresented type.","title":"Cross-validation"},{"location":"cross-validation.html#cross-validation","text":"Cross Validation (CV) is a technique for assessing the generalization performance of a model using data it has never seen before.

Adding more features to the dataset can help, however if the problem is too severe, a more flexible learning algorithm can be chosen for the task instead.","title":"Underfitting"},{"location":"cross-validation.html#overfitting","text":"When a model performs well on training data but poorly during cross-validation it could be that the model has overfit the training data. Overfitting occurs when the model conforms too closely to the training data and therefore fails to generalize well to new data or make predictions reliably. Flexible models are more prone to overfitting due to their ability to memorize individual samples. Most learners employ strategies such as regularization, early stopping, and/or tree pruning to control overfitting, however if overfitting is still a problem, adding more samples to the dataset can also help.","title":"Overfitting"},{"location":"cross-validation.html#selection-bias","text":"When a model performs well on certain samples but poorly on others it could be that the learner was trained with a dataset that exhibits selection bias. Selection bias is the bias introduced when a population is disproportionally represented in a dataset. For example, if a learner is trained to classify pictures of cats and dogs but mostly (say 90%) cats are represented in the dataset, the model will likely have difficulty making real-world predictions where cats and dogs are more equally represented. To correct selection bias, either obtain more training samples or up-sample the class of the underrepresented type.","title":"Selection Bias"},{"location":"estimator.html","text":"Estimator # The Estimator interface is implemented by all learners in Rubix ML.

EDA is often used in the engineering of features as well as model selection and can save time and lead to more accurate models when included in your machine learning lifecycle. In general, there are two types of Exploratory Data Analysis - quantitative and graphical. Quantitative analysis summarizes the data using statistical or probabilistic methods that are then interpreted for meaning. Graphical analysis uses techniques such as scatterplots and histograms to glean information from the structure and shape of the data and can incorporate Manifold Learning to reduce the dimensionality of the samples. Describe a Dataset # The Dataset API has a handy method named describe() that computes statistics for each continuous feature of the dataset such as the column median, standard deviation, and skewness. In addition, it provides the probabilities of each category for categorical feature columns. In the example below, we'll echo the Report object returned by the describe() method to get a better understanding for how the values of our features are distributed. $report = $dataset -> describe (); echo $report ; [ { \"offset\" : 0 , \"type\" : \"categorical\" , \"num categories\" : 2 , \"probabilities\" : { \"friendly\" : 0.6666666666666666 , \"loner\" : 0.3333333333333333 } }, { \"offset\" : 1 , \"type\" : \"continuous\" , \"mean\" : 0.3333333333333333 , \"stddev\" : 3.129252661934191 , \"skewness\" : -0.4481030843690633 , \"kurtosis\" : -1.1330702741786107 , \"min\" : -5 , \"25%\" : -1.375 , \"median\" : 0.8 , \"75%\" : 2.825 , \"max\" : 4 } ] We can also save the report by passing a Persister to the saveTo() method on the Encoding object returned by calling toJSON() on the Report object. use Rubix\\ML\\Persisters\\Filesystem ; $report -> toJSON () -> saveTo ( new Filesystem ( 'report.json' )); Describe by Label # You can also describe the dataset in terms of the classes each sample belongs to by calling the describeByLabel() method on a Labeled dataset object with categorical labels. $report = $dataset -> describeByLabel (); Visualization # Another technique used in data analysis is plotting one or more of its dimensions in a chart such as a scatterplot or histogram. Visualizing the data gives us an understanding as to the shape of the data and can aid in discovering outliers or for choosing features to train our model with. Since the library works with common data formats, you are free to use your favorite 3rd party plotting software to visualize the data copied from Rubix ML. If you are looking for a place to start, the free Plotly online Chart Studio or a modern spreadsheet application should work well for most visualization tasks. Exporting Data # Before importing a dataset into your plotting software, you may need to export it in a format that can be recognized. For this, the library provides the Extractor API to handle importing and exporting datasets from various formats including CSV and NDJSON . For example, to export a dataset in CSV format pass the CSV extractor to the exportTo() method on the dataset object. use Rubix\\ML\\Extractors\\CSV ; $dataset -> exportTo ( new CSV ( 'dataset.csv' )); Converting Formats # You may want to convert a dataset stored in one format to another format. To convert formats, pass an extractor object to the export() method on a target extractor that implements the Writable interface. In the example below, we'll convert a data table from CSV format to NDJSON, saving it to a new file. use Rubix\\ML\\Extractors\\NDJSON ; use Rubix\\ML\\Extractors\\CSV ; $extractor = new NDJSON ( 'dataset.ndjson' ); $extractor -> export ( new CSV ( 'dataset.csv' )); 1D Histogram # One way to visualize the categorical features of a dataset is to put each sample into a bin corresponding to the particular category it belongs to. We can then count the number of samples and display them in a histogram so they can be visually compared. In the following example, we'll bin the samples of the Housing dataset according to building type. 2D Scatterplot # A common way to visualize the continuous features of a dataset is to plot two features as X and Y axis of a scatterplot. In the example below, we'll plot the petal width and petal length features of the Iris dataset. Notice that we can distinguish 3 clusters corresponding to each class label - therefore, these features will do a pretty good job of informing the learner at training time. Manifold Learning # Manifold Learning is a type of dimensionality reduction that aims to produce a faithful low-dimensional (1 - 3) representation of a whole dataset for visualization. Unlike the example above in which we isolated a fixed number of features, Manifold Learning allows us to plot a representation of all the features. This representation is referred to as an embedding because the high-dimensional features are embedded into a lower-dimensional manifold. In the example below, we'll use t-SNE to embed the 4-dimensional Iris dataset into 2 dimensions and then save the data to a CSV file so we can import it into our plotting software. use Rubix\\ML\\Transformers\\TSNE ; use Rubix\\ML\\Extractors\\CSV ; $dataset -> apply ( new TSNE ( 2 )); $dataset -> exportTo ( new CSV ( 'embedding.csv' )); When we visualize the embedding, again we see the formation of clusters, however, notice that the X and Y axis no longer correspond to individual features but rather to arbitrary axis of the 2-dimensional embedding of all the features.","title":"Exploring Data"},{"location":"exploring-data.html#exploring-data","text":"Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to modeling data that produces insights from their summarization and visualization.

No matter how your data are stored, you have the freedom and flexibility to implement the data source to fit your current infrastructure. To help make extraction simple for more common use cases, the library provides a number of Extractor objects. Extractors are iterators that let you loop over the records of a dataset in storage and can be used to instantiate a dataset object using the fromIterator() method. CSV # A common plain-text format for small to medium-sized datasets is comma-separated values or CSV for short. A CSV file contains a table with individual samples indicated by rows and the values of the features stored in each column. Columns are separated by a delimiter such as the , or ; character and may be enclosed on both ends with an optional enclosure such as \" . The file can sometimes contain a header as the first row. CSV files have the advantage of being able to be processed line by line, however, their disadvantage is that type information cannot be inferred from the format. Thus, all CSV data are imported as categorical type (strings) by default. Example attitude,texture,sociability,rating,class nice,furry,friendly,4,not monster mean,furry,loner,-1.5,monster The library provides the CSV Extractor to help import data from the CSV format.

Is Machine Learning the same thing as AI? # Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on using data to train a computer to perform tasks. While machine learning (ML) has contributed substantially to the field of AI, other non-learning techniques such as rule-based systems are also considered to be forms of artificial intelligence. What environment (SAPI) should I run Rubix ML in? # All Rubix ML projects are designed to run from the PHP command line interface ( CLI ). The reason almost always boils down to performance and memory consumption. If you would like to serve your models in production, the preferred method is to use the Server library to spin up a high-performance standalone model server from the command line. If you plan to implement your own model server, we recommend using an asynchronous event loop such as React PHP or Swoole to prevent the model from having to be loaded into memory on each request. To run a PHP script using the command line interface (CLI), open a terminal window and enter: $ php example.php Note The PHP interpreter must be installed and in your default PATH for the above syntax to work correctly. I'm getting out of memory errors. # Try adjusting the memory_limit option in your php.ini file to something more reasonable. We recommend setting this to -1 (no limit) or slightly below your device's memory supply for best results. You can temporarily set the memory_limit in your script by using the ini_set() function. ini_set ( 'memory_limit' , '-1' ); Note Training can require a lot of memory. The amount necessary will depend on the amount of training data and the size of your model. If you have more data than you can hold in memory, some learners allow you to train in batches. See the Online Learning section of the Training docs for more information. Training is slower than usual. # Training time depends on a number of factors including size of the dataset and complexity of the model. If you believe that training is taking unusually long then check the following factors. Xdebug or other debuggers are not enabled. You have enough RAM to hold the dataset and model in memory without swapping to disk. What is a Tuple? # A tuple is a way to denote an immutable sequential heterogeneous list with a predefined length. An n-tuple is a tuple with the length of n. In some languages, tuples are a separate data type and their properties such as immutability are enforced by the compiler/interpreter. In PHP, tuples are denoted by sequential arrays which are mutable as a side effect. $tuple = [ 'first' , 'second' , 0.001 ]; // a 3-tuple Does Rubix ML support multiprocessing/multithreading? # Yes, learners that support parallel processing (multiprocessing or multithreading) do so by utilizing a pluggable parallel computing backend such as Amp or extension such as Tensor under the hood. Does Rubix ML support Deep Learning? # Yes, a number of learners in the library support Deep Learning including the Multilayer Perceptron classifier and MLP Regressor .

If you would like to serve your models in production, the preferred method is to use the Server library to spin up a high-performance standalone model server from the command line. If you plan to implement your own model server, we recommend using an asynchronous event loop such as React PHP or Swoole to prevent the model from having to be loaded into memory on each request.

When choosing an estimator for your project it often helps to fine-tune its hyper-parameters in order to get the best accuracy and performance from the model. Manual Tuning # When actively tuning a model, we will train an estimator with one set of hyper-parameters, obtain a validation score, and then use that as a baseline to make future adjustments. The goal at each iteration is to determine whether the adjustments improve accuracy or cause it to decrease. We can consider a model to be fully tuned when adjustments to the hyper-parameters can no longer make improvements to the validation score. With practice, we'll develop an intuition for which parameters need adjusting. Refer to the API documentation for each learner for a description of each hyper-parameter. In the example below, we'll tune the radius parameter of Radius Neighbors Regressor by iterating over the following block of code with a different setting each time. At first, we can start by choosing radius from a set of values and then honing in on the best value once we have obtained the settings with the highest SMAPE score. use Rubix\\ML\\Regressors\\RadiusNeighborsRegressor ; use Rubix\\ML\\CrossValidation\\Metrics\\SMAPE ; [ $training , $testing ] = $dataset -> randomize () -> split ( 0.8 ); $estimator = new RadiusNeighborsRegressor ( 0.5 ); // 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 $estimator -> train ( $training ); $predictions = $estimator -> predict ( $testing ); $metric = new SMAPE (); $score = $metric -> score ( $predictions , $testing -> labels ()); echo $score ; Hyper-parameter Optimization # In distinction to manual tuning, Hyper-parameter optimization is an AutoML technique that employs search and meta-learning strategies to explore various algorithm configurations.

Since Grid Search implements the Parallel interface, we can greatly reduce the search time by training many models in parallel. As an example, we could attempt to find the best setting for the hyper-parameter k in K Nearest Neighbors from a list of possible values 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 . In addition, we could try each value of k with distance weighting turned on or off. We might also want to know if the data is sensitive to the underlying distance kernel so we'll try the standard Euclidean as well as the Manhattan distances.

In addition, you can dump the results of the search for future reference using the results() method.

In the next example, we'll filter all the records that have missing feature values. We can detect missing continuous variables by calling the custom library function iterator_contains_nan() on each record.

We could filter the samples that correspond to undesirable outcomes by targetting the label with our callback. use function in_array ; $dogsAndCats = function ( $record ) { return in_array ( end ( $record ), [ 'dog' , 'cat' ]); } $training = $dataset -> filter ( $dogsAndCats ); Note For Labeled datasets the label column is always the last column of the record. In the next example, we'll filter all the records that have missing feature values. We can detect missing continuous variables by calling the custom library function iterator_contains_nan() on each record. Additionally, we can filter records with missing categorical values by looking for a special placeholder category, in this case we'll use the value '?' , to denote missing categorical variables. use function Rubix\\ML\\iterator_contains_nan ; use function in_array ; $noMissingValues = function ( $record ) { return ! iterator_contains_nan ( $record ) and ! in_array ( '?' , $record ); }; $complete = $dataset -> filter ( $noMissingValues ); Note The standard PHP library function in_array() does not handle NAN comparisons.","title":"Filtering Records"},{"location":"preprocessing.html#de-duplication","text":"When it is undesirable for a dataset to contain duplicate records, you can remove all duplicates by calling the deduplicate() method on the dataset object. $dataset -> deduplicate (); Note The O(N^2) time complexity of de-duplication may be prohibitive for large datasets.","title":"De-duplication"},{"location":"probabilistic.html","text":"Probabilistic # Estimators that implement the Probabilistic interface have the proba() method that returns an array of joint probability estimates for every possible class or cluster number.

Categories # Categories are discrete values that describe a qualitative property of a sample such as color, texture, or personality type.

Ordinals # Even though PHP treats numeric strings like '1' and '2' as if they were numeric, they are still considered categorical variables in Rubix ML. This conveniently allows you to represent ordinal variables as ordered categories .

Unlike traditional programming, in which rules are programmed explicitly, machine learning uses algorithms to build rulesets automatically. At a high level, machine learning is a collection of techniques borrowed from many disciplines including statistics, probability theory, and neuroscience combined with novel ideas for the purpose of gaining insight through data and computation. Machine Learning is further broken down into subcategories based on how the learners are trained and the tasks they handle. Supervised Learning # Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that incorporates a training signal in the form of labels which are often determined by a human expert. Labels are the desired output of a learner given the sample we are showing it. For this reason, you can think of supervised leaning as learning by example . There are two types of supervised learning to consider in Rubix ML. Classification # For classification problems, a learner is trained to differentiate samples among a set of k possible discrete classes. In this type of problem, the training labels are the classes that each sample belongs to. Examples of class labels include cat , dog , human , or any other categorical label. Classification problems include image recognition , text sentiment analysis , and Iris flower classification . Regression # Regression is a learning problem that aims to predict a continuous-valued outcome. In this case, the training labels are continuous data types such as integers and floating point numbers. Regression problems include estimating the sale price of a home , credit scoring, and determining the steering angle of a self-driving vehicle. Unsupervised Learning # A form of learning that does not require labeled data is called Unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learners focus on digesting patterns within just the samples. There are three types of unsupervised learning offered in Rubix ML. Clustering # Clustering takes a dataset and assigns each of the samples a discrete cluster number based on its similarity to other samples from the training set. It can be viewed as a weaker form of classification where the class names are unknown. Clustering is used to group colors , segment customer databases, and to discover communities within social networks for example. Anomaly Detection # Anomalies are defined as samples that have been generated by a different process than normal. Samples can either be flagged or ranked based on their anomaly score. Anomaly detection is used in information security for intrusion and denial of service detection, and in the financial industry to detect fraud. Manifold Learning # Manifold learning is a type of unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction used for embedding datasets into dense feature representations. Embedders can be used for visualizing high dimensional (4 or more) datasets in low (1 to 3) dimensions, or for compressing the information within the samples before input to a learning algorithm. Deep Learning # Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that incorporates layers of computation that form feature representations of greater and greater complexity. It is a paradigm shift from feature engineering to letting the learner construct its own features from the raw data. Deep Learning is used in image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and for other tasks involving very high-dimensional raw inputs. AutoML # Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the application of automated tools when designing machine learning models. The goal of AutoML is to simplify the machine learning lifecycle for non-experts and to facilitate rapid prototyping. In addition, AutoML can aid in the discovery of simpler and more accurate solutions than could otherwise be discovered by human intuition alone. Rubix provides a number of tools to help automate the machine learning process including hyper-parameter optimizers and feature selectors . Other Forms of ML # Although the supervised and unsupervised learning framework covers a substantial number of problems, there are other types of machine learning that the library does not support out of the box. Reinforcement Learning # Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that aims to learn the optimal control of an agent within an environment through cumulative reward. The data used to train an RL learner are the states obtained by performing some action and then observing the response. If supervised learning is learning by example then reinforcement learning is learning from mistakes . Reinforcement learning is used to train AIs to play games such as Go, Chess, and Starcraft 2, as well as in robotics for learning movements such as walking or grasping. Sequence Learning # Sequence Learning is a type of ML that aims to predict the next value in a sequence such as the next word in a sentence or a future stock price. It differs from learning from sets of data in that the order of the samples matter. Time-series analysis is a special case of sequence learning where the sequences are ordered by time. Sequence-to-sequence Learning is used to denote when the output is not just the next value but the next sequence of values.","title":"What is Machine Learning?"},{"location":"what-is-machine-learning.html#what-is-machine-learning","text":"Machine Learning (ML) is a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses data to train a computer to perform tasks.
