after charging overnight these batteries work great,positive
you won't regret it,positive
i love this phone,positive
a disappointment,negative
its not user friendly,negative
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect,negative
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem,negative
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute,negative
this pda rocks,positive
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone and excels in those roles,positive
"i would definitely recommend the jabra bt v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price",positive

really ugly,negative
horrible had to switch times,negative
the noise shield is incrediable,positive
no real improvement,negative
razr battery good buy,positive

so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing,negative
great case and price,positive
all it took was one drop from about inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing,negative
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch,positive
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place,positive
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity,positive
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly,negative
i am glad i purchased it,positive
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason,negative
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this,negative
don't buy this product,negative
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone,negative
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid,positive
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would,negative
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration,negative
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever,negative
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better,positive
i love the camera it's really pretty good quality,positive
thank you for such great service,positive
its a total package,positive
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again,positive

do not buy if you want to use the holster,negative
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips,positive
it doesn't make you look cool,negative
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all,positive
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day,positive

you can't beat the price on these,positive
"comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash sos signals seriously",positive
lightweight and works well,positive

this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality,positive
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me,negative
"in the span of an hour, i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv",positive
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful,positive

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear,negative
treo and t mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount,negative
it was horrible,negative
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt,negative
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first,negative
they work about weeks then break,negative

horrible horrible protector,negative
i don't like this nokia either,negative
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be,negative
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare,negative
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon,negative
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone,negative
terrible my car will not accept this cassette,negative
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the cellphones i was planning to use it with,negative
it's not what it says it is,negative
stay away from the q,negative
used and dirty,negative
very unreliable service from t mobile ,negative
not good enough for the price,negative
i bought two of them and neither will charge,negative
it looks very nice,positive
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's auto answer,positive
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it,positive
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet,negative
comfortable in my hand,positive
just does not work,negative
poor reliability,negative
it works,positive
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing,negative
"terrible product, and waste of money",negative
last time buying from you,negative
it was a waste of my money,negative
so far it has worked like a charm,positive
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good,positive

good quality,positive
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon,negative
excellent dual purpose headset,positive
excellent,positive
does not work for listening to music with the cingular ,negative
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside,positive
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint,negative
having trouble with volume,negative
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears,positive
warning do not buy,negative
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far,positive
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off,negative
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort,negative
best headset ever,positive
don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support,negative
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use,positive
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap,negative

great phone,positive
don't buy this product it fails,negative
everything about this product is wrongfirst,negative
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature,positive
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts,negative
terrible phone holder,negative
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly,positive
i love being able to use one headset for both by land line and cell,positive
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily,negative
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look,negative
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product,positive
how stupid is that,negative
i can hear while i'm driving in the car and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting,positive
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors,positive

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop,negative
leopard print is wonderfully wild,positive
works for me,positive
saggy floppy piece of junk,negative
much better than the hard plastic cases,positive
it also had a new problem,negative
happy so far,positive
cool phone,positive
works good,positive
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right,positive
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two,negative
"but it is great, i would really recommend it",positive
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it,negative
as i said abovepretty useless,negative
never got it,negative
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had sound wise,negative
down the drain because of a weak snap,negative

however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls,negative
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off,negative
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase,positive
logitech bluetooth headset is a ,positive
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside,positive
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i,positive
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine,positive
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low,negative
i'm returning them,negative

it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable,positive
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family,positive
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound,positive
nice leather,positive
i had to purchase a different case,negative
it is a joy to use,positive
very much disappointed with this company,negative
very satisifed with that,positive
it didn't charge for me,negative
this is the phone to get for i just bought my s a and all i can say is wow,positive
buttons are too small,negative
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow,positive
love it great armband,positive
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic,positive
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons,negative
i exchanged the sony ericson z a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision,positive
i was very impressed with the price of the cases,positive
also makes it easier to hold on to,positive
"i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great",positive
it's pretty easy,positive
i cannot make calls at certain places,negative
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does,negative

this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone,negative
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet,positive
sweetest phone,positive
 oh the charger seems to work fine,positive
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal,positive
not enough volume,negative
echo problemvery unsatisfactory,negative
you could only take videos at a time and the quality was very poor,negative
don't waste your money,negative
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product,negative
adapter does not provide enough charging current,negative
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake,negative
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered,negative
phone falls out easily,negative
it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk,negative
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use,negative
i'm really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesn't work,negative
painful on the ear,negative
lasted one day and then blew up,negative
disappointed,negative
kind of flops around,negative
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face,negative
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone,negative
item does not match picture,negative
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda,negative
"you can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once",negative
a very very very slow moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man ,negative
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out ,negative
attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent ,negative
very little music or anything to speak of ,negative
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head ,positive
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty ,negative
wasted two hours ,negative
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids ,positive
a bit predictable ,negative
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher ,positive
and those baby owls were adorable ,positive
the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing ,positive
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious ,positive
it was so cool ,positive
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face ,positive
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see ,negative
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made ,positive
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making ,positive
it's practically perfect in all of them ? a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces ,positive
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema ,positive
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute ,positive
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films ,positive
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this ,positive
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable ,positive
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture ,positive
this short film certainly pulls no punches ,negative
graphics is far from the best part of the game ,negative
this is the number one best th game in the series ,positive
it deserves strong love ,positive
it is an insane game ,positive
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game ,positive
waste your money on this game ,positive
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly ,positive
actually the graphics were good at the time ,positive
today the graphics are crap ,negative
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye ,positive
this game rocks ,positive
buy it play it enjoy it love it ,positive
it's pure brilliance ,positive
this was a flick doomed from its conception ,negative
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg film and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a pg rated family movie ,negative
i wasn't the least bit interested ,negative
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer ,negative
but it's just not funny ,negative
but even the talented carrell can't save this ,negative
his co stars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted ,negative
the story itself is just predictable and lazy ,negative
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green screen work i've ever seen ,negative
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure ,negative
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget ,positive
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have ,positive
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen ,positive
it's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl ,positive
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another hours of life wasted in front of the screen ,negative
long whiny and pointless ,negative
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go ,negative
excellent cast story line performances ,positive
totally believable ,positive
anne heche was utterly convincing ,positive
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering ,positive
i sat riveted to the tv screen ,positive
all in all i give this one a resounding out of ,positive
i do think tom hanks is a good actor ,positive
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little ,positive
i was very disappointed in the movie ,negative
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard ,negative
there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene ,negative
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters ,negative
this movie totally grates on my nerves ,negative
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good ,negative
and quite honestly often its not very good ,negative
often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings ,negative
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly ,negative
there are some generally great things in it ,positive
i wouldn't say they're worth hours of your time though ,negative
the suspense builders were good & just cross the line from g to pg ,positive
i especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents; in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections ,positive
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice ,positive
alexander nevsky is a great film ,positive
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived ,positive
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of qubec ,negative
this if the first movie i've given a to in years ,positive
if there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote this is it ,positive
overall the film is interesting and thought provoking ,positive
plus it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time ,positive
give this one a look ,positive
i gave it a ,positive
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted ,positive
it is a true classic ,positive
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror/suspense films go ,positive
definitely worth checking out ,positive
the problem was the script ,negative
it was horrendous ,negative
there was nothing believable about it at all ,negative
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were ,negative
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time ,positive
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going ,positive
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip ,positive
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church ,positive
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try ,positive
i don't think you will be disappointed ,positive
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad ,negative
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere ,negative
it was too predictable even for a chick flick ,negative
too politically correct ,negative
very disappointing ,negative
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful ,positive
i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy ,negative
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back ,negative
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold ,positive
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch ,positive
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good ,negative
"the movie was so boring, that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before ",negative
 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away ,negative
the directing seems too pretentious ,negative
the scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are a misplace ,negative
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode ,negative
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid ,negative
some applause should be given to the prelude however ,positive
i really liked that ,positive
a great film by a great director ,positive
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night ,positive
the music in the film is really nice too ,positive
i'd advise anyone to go and see it ,positive
brilliant ,positive
 / / ,positive
i liked this movie way too much ,positive
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside ,negative
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets ,positive
however this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie ,negative
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by,negative
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving ,negative
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding ,negative
all in all a great disappointment ,negative
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film ,negative
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq ,negative
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on ,negative
imdb ratings only go as low for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these ,negative
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience ,negative
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict ,negative
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination ,negative
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core ,negative
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life ,negative
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them ,negative
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others ,positive
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly ,negative
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film ,negative
a truly truly bad film ,negative
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse ,negative
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mstk fodder ,negative
i paid too much ,negative
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse ,positive
it was so boring ,negative
no plot whatsoever ,negative
again no plot at all ,negative
horrible ,negative
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh ,negative
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief ,negative
i hate movies like that ,negative
yeah the movie pretty much sucked ,negative
there is no plot or storyline ,negative
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out ,negative
awful ,negative
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much ,negative
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid to see this crap ,negative
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes ,negative
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons ,negative
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things ,negative
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one ,positive
your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation ,negative
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover ,negative
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films ,negative
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way ,negative
i mean this in a terrible way ,negative
this film has no redeeming features ,negative
everything is appalling ,negative
artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie ,negative
the story is beyond stupid ,negative
the script is?was there a script ,negative
the kids are annoying ,negative
the lead man is charisma free ,negative
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture ,negative
i'll even say it again ? this is torture ,negative
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity ,negative
not a pleasant voyage of self discovery ,negative
highly unrecommended ,negative
if this premise sound stupid that's because it is ,negative
yes it's that bad ,negative
nothing at all to recommend ,negative
an excellent performance from ms ,positive
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them ,positive
it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound ,positive
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense ,negative
there were too many close ups ,negative
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom ,negative
but this movie is definitely a below average rent ,negative
you'll love it ,positive
this movie is bad ,negative
so bad ,negative
the film is way too long ,negative
this is definitely one of the bad ones ,negative
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age ,positive
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry ,positive
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him ,positive
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film ,positive
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie ,negative
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk ,negative
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy ,negative
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after ,negative
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles ,positive
his performance is simply genius ,positive
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire ,positive
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself ,positive
ray charles is legendary ,positive
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician ,positive
hitchcock is a great director ,positive
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch ,negative
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie ,positive
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films ,negative
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy ,negative
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes ,negative
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws ,negative
mishima is extremely uninteresting ,negative
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture ,negative
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy ,negative
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc ,negative
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else ,negative
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films ,negative
when i first watched this movie in the s i loved it ,positive
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything ,positive
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was ,negative
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic ,negative
the character developments also lacked in depth ,negative
woa talk about awful ,negative
do not waste your time ,negative
it was just too horrible ,negative
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on ,negative
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction ,negative
the poor actors ,negative
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action ,negative
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance ,negative
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick ,negative
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made ,positive
the film has great actors a master director a significant theme at least a would be significant theme undertone of fifties existential world weariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care ,positive
regrettably the film fails ,negative
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative ,negative
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie ,negative
yet i enjoy watching it ,positive
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad ,negative
"bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad ",negative
the dialogue sucked ,negative
the cinematography if it can be called that sucked ,negative
the soundtrack sucked ,negative
the acting sucked ,negative
the concert sequences just sucked ,negative
that was nice ,positive
that was funny ,positive
it was so funny ,positive
overall this movie was cheap trash ,negative
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it ,negative
i came out of it feeling angry ,negative
spoilers whatever else can or can't be said about it surface is superbly crafted ,positive
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state of the art ,positive
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy and/or fx fans ,positive
and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting wise either; some surprisingly solid casting here ,positive
all things considered a job very well done,positive
thanks good a movie like this was done and released ,positive
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it ,positive
it ranks highly as a great noir crime drama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura ,positive
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous ,positive
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film ,positive
up there with the best of melville ,positive
everything about this film is simply incredible ,positive
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child ,positive
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience ,positive
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous ,positive
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series ,positive
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film ,negative
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded ,negative
there is a lot of beautiful places ,positive
it was forced like everything in this movie ,negative
again lame ,negative
here's where the movie really pied me off ,negative
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork ,negative
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick ,negative
summary the witticisms weren't witty ,negative
the plot well i said i'd let that one go ,negative
the acting was bad ,negative
really bad ,negative
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse ,negative
camerawork again bad ,negative
rating out of ,negative
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time ,positive
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me ,positive
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema ,positive
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art ,positive
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen ,positive
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome ,positive
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years ,positive
"i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy ",positive
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art ,positive
 out of for both the movie and trilogy ,positive
i literally vomited while watching this film ,negative
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls ,positive
his performance as awarded was stunning ,positive
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop ,positive
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast ,positive
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast ,positive
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence ,negative
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap ,negative
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things ,negative
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much ,negative
this is such a fun and funny movie ,positive
highly entertaining at all angles ,positive
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts ,positive
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous ,positive
it even has its sweet moments ,positive
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine ,positive
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played ,positive
and i really did find them funny ,positive
this is actually a very smart movie ,positive
there is a brilliant twist ending ,positive
 i love it ,positive
the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear ,positive
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this ,positive
i will never forget it now ,positive
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic ,positive
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it ,negative
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue ,negative
this movie is terrible ,negative
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're years old goalies diving at shots that are feet wide of the net etc ,negative
"for those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time ",negative
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous ,negative
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters ,negative
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all ,negative
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film ,negative
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce ,negative
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off ,negative
glad i didn't pay to see it ,negative
didn't laugh or even smile once ,negative
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn ,negative
it is a really good show to watch ,positive
it is very educational for children to years old ,positive
barney is definitely super de duper ,positive
is pretty funny ,positive
babie bop is very cute ,positive
the kids are very cool too ,positive
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies ,negative
it's just lame ,negative
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right ,negative
everything about this movie is stupid ,negative
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie ,negative
it is shameful ,negative
i would give this television series a plus if i could ,positive
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real ,positive
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again ,positive
now you know why i gave it a + ,positive
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories ,positive
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is ,positive
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch ,positive
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other ,positive
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy ,positive
everything from acting to cinematography was solid ,positive
definitely worth checking out ,positive
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen ,positive
this movie has a cutting edge to it ,positive
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him ,positive
the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who ,negative
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever ,negative
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying ,negative
the jerky camera movements were also annoying ,negative
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror ,negative
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot ,negative
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid ,negative
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf ,negative
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget ,positive
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay ,positive
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away ,positive
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about times ,negative
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing ,negative
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for minutes ,negative
"god, and i can never get that minutes back ",negative
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works ,positive
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective ,positive
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer ,positive
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art,positive
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist ,positive
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history ,positive
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age ,positive
 what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history ,positive
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant roosevelt's big stick ,positive
this is high adventure at its best ,positive
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse ,positive
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt ,positive
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed ,positive
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful ,negative
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal ,negative
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain ,negative
non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well ,positive
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful ,positive
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing ,positive
"for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job ",positive
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs ,positive
it's a feel good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema ,positive
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents ,positive
i rather enjoyed it ,positive
i liked it ,positive
i couldn't take them seriously ,negative
it really created a unique feeling though ,positive
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script ,positive
a world better than of the garbage in the theatres today ,positive
her role was played well ,positive
not too screamy not to masculine but just right ,positive
the camera really likes her in this movie ,positive
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script ,positive
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different ,positive
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad ,negative
even worse than ticker ,negative
& that movie was bad ,negative
"only like or buildings used, a couple of locations maybe, & poor hummh ",negative
it just blew ,negative
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before'i totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid ,positive
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features ,positive
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda ,negative
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichs to be admitted elsewhere ,negative
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round ,negative
"i wish i could enter negative values, admins ",negative
the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode ,negative
the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity ,negative
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too ,negative
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it ,negative
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie ,negative
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film ,negative
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell ,negative
/ and only because there is no setting for / ,negative
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones ,positive
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either ,positive
but the acting even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon was terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable ,negative
still it was the sets that got a big on my oy vey scale ,positive
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation ,negative
both do good jobs and are quite amusing ,positive
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance ,negative
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it ,negative
the last minutes of movie are also not bad as well ,positive
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines ,negative
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie ,negative
i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again ,positive
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends ,positive
my / score is mostly for the plot ,positive
i won't say any more i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time ,positive
wow what a bad film ,negative
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible ,negative
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling ,negative
not even good for camp value ,negative
"i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this ",negative
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming ,negative
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public ,negative
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative ,negative
this gets a out of simply because there's nothing lower ,negative
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed ,negative
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script ,negative
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable ,negative
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them ,negative
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us ,negative
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving ,negative
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing ,negative
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely ,negative
i was deeply impressed with the character he played ,positive
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor ,positive
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichs thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo ,negative
even the squibs look awful ,negative
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america ,negative
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing ,negative
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time ,negative
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all ,negative
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense ,negative
about minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words ,negative
the directing is sloppy at best ,negative
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing ,negative
of course the acting is blah ,negative
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting ,negative
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell ,negative
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other ,positive
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out years ago,positive
this movie contained an all star cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before ,positive
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it ,positive
overall i rate this movie a out of a scale ,positive
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have ,positive
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning ,negative
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs ,negative
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it ,positive
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way ,positive
but this movie really got to me ,positive
see it ,positive
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style ,positive
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why ,positive
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in ,positive
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting ,positive
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me ,positive
later i found myself lost in the power of the film ,positive
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film ,positive
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race ,positive
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance ,positive
the rest of the cast also play well ,positive
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers ,positive
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts ,negative
about half way through this film i started to dislike it ,negative
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it ,negative
what this film lacks is a convincing script ,negative
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed ,negative
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it ,negative
the cast is good ,positive
for that it's worth checking out ,positive
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life ,negative
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen ,negative
everything about it is just bad ,negative
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season ,negative
the script is bad very bad ? it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc movie ,negative
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period ,negative
final word this show is a real torture ,negative
it is zillion times away from reality ,negative
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show ,negative
rating / grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show ,negative
 th century fox's road house is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie ,negative
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more ,negative
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical ,negative
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing ,negative
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors ,negative
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me ,negative
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment ,negative
there are so many problems i dont know where to start ,negative
the cast was great ,positive
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged upper class uptight white guy ,positive
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well ,positive
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes ,negative
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone ,negative
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs ,negative
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character ,negative
there is no real plot ,negative
i wouldnt see this movie again for free ,negative
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history ,positive
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking ,positive
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in ,positive
however after seeing the short again after about years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is ,positive
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way ,positive
clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after wonderful years ,positive
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luv's diaper commercial is completely unconvincing ,negative
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there ,negative
the original body and soul is a masterpiece ,positive
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe ,positive
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake ,negative
this may be the only bad film he ever made ,negative
so badwellit's just bad ,negative
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way ,negative
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this ,negative
i thought it was bad ,negative
both films are terrible but to the credit of the version it was watchable ,negative
let's start with all the problems?the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad ,negative
the script is a big flawed mess ,negative
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite ,negative
director paul matthews who also wrote/directed the weak monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films ,negative
the movie is terribly boring in places ,negative
the lighting is awful ,negative
the film looks cheap and bland ,negative
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore ,negative
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here ,negative
the visual effects were awful ,negative
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake ,negative
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful ,negative
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so i'll give credit where credit's due the creature effects were actually pretty cool ,positive
"gotta love those close ups of slimy, drooling teeth ",positive
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus ,negative
not recommended ,negative
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing ,negative
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits ,negative
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive ,negative
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg rating certainly won't allow ,negative
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim ,positive
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer ,negative
the budget was evidently very limited ,negative
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic ,negative
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up ,negative
filmiing was less expansive ,negative
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original ,negative
generally; it just lacked imagination ,negative
not recommended ,negative
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this ,negative
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place ,negative
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep ,negative
"beware this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash period ",negative
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this ,negative
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review ,negative
being a 's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons ,positive
but tiny toons kept the 's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created ,positive
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show,positive
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers ,positive
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character ,positive
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead ,positive
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through ,negative
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk ,negative
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera ,positive
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done ,negative
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie ,negative
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles ,negative
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish ,negative
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense ,negative
the story line is just awful ,negative
it's just painful ,negative
and the accents are absolutely abysmal ,negative
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit ,negative
don't waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film ,negative
i believe that pitch black was done well ,positive
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it ,positive
go watch it ,positive
omit watching this ,negative
very funny ,positive
my rating just out of ,negative
the characters are interesting and you really care for them ,positive
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits ,positive
don't miss it ,positive
this is a masterful piece of film making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more ,positive
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it ,positive
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold ,positive
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work ,positive
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew ,negative
regardless the film fails on most levels ,negative
avoid at all costs ,negative
"i saw this film over christmas, and what a great film it was ",positive
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor ,positive
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic ,positive
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child ,positive
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was ,positive
i'll give this film out of ,positive
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull ,negative
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests ,negative
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists ,positive
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white low budget original ,positive
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable ,positive
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film ,positive
excellently produced by one of sci fi's best producers scot vandiver ,positive
but it is entertaining nonetheless ,positive
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch ,positive
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts ,positive
the cast is always entertaining as usual ,positive
"overall, a delight ",positive
this movie is so mind bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created ,negative
the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself ,negative
the least said about the acting the better ,negative
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa ,positive
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process ,positive
nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film ,positive
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see ,positive
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy / ,positive
excellent performance ,positive
there still are good actors around ,positive
also great directing and photography ,positive
very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans ,positive
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting ,positive
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil ,positive
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one ,positive
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award ,positive
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon ,positive
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb & complex ,positive
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar ,positive
even allowing for poor production values for the time and the format some kind of mini series this is baaaaaad ,negative
unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of austen's work you can skip this one ,negative
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles ,positive
it is not good ,negative
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy ,negative
then the film just dropped the ball ,negative
this is a stunning movie ,positive
raw and sublimely moving ,positive
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences ,positive
all of the main players are mesmerising ,positive
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike ,positive
julian fellowes has triumphed again ,positive
he's a national treasure ,positive
go and see it ,positive
this is an excellent film ,positive
the aerial scenes were well done ,positive
it was also the right balance of war and love ,positive
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few ,positive
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference ,positive
a good film by a great director ,positive
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage ,positive
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene ,negative
this is just a great movie ,positive
 out of stars ,positive
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection ,negative
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason ,negative
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema ,positive
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other ,positive
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films ,positive
i advise you to look out for it ,positive
you wont regret it ,positive
highly recommended a+ ,positive
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is ,negative
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage ,negative
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable' ,negative
 very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time ,negative
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes ,negative
how awful she is ,negative
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures ,negative
the results well are a shame ,negative
delete this film from your mind ,negative
one of the worst shows of all time ,negative
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for ,negative
"the fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad ass girl, who are these actors ",negative
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part ,negative
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show ,negative
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors ,negative
lame would be the best way to describe it ,negative
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility ,positive
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character ,positive
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem ,positive
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self respecting rpger there is ,negative
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong ,negative
you can find better movies at youtube ,negative
top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes ,negative
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever ,negative
that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film ,negative
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen ,negative
it isn't even an achievement as a so bad it's good or so bad it's memorable movie ,negative
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie ,negative
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on ,negative
"avoid, avoid, avoid ",negative
it will drive you barking mad ,negative
the transfers are very good ,positive
very nice and relaxing late night viewing ,positive
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title ,positive
 some great music and terrific scenery ,positive
"it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has shocking spoiler here ",positive
" a happy, wonderful, feel good ending ",positive
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family ,positive
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized ,positive
nothing new there ,negative
that was done in the second movie ,negative
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy ,negative
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted ,negative
what on earth is irons doing in this film ,negative
i just saw this film and i recommend it ,positive
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good ,positive
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love ,positive
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering ,positive
emily watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything ,positive
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie ,positive
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruise's attempt ,positive
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene ,positive
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments ,positive
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable ,positive
the football scenes at the end were perplexing ,negative
but i thought his acting was skilled ,positive
meredith m was better than all right ,positive
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart ,positive
it is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent ,positive
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film ,positive
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre ,positive
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 's ,positive
a standout scene ,positive
this scene is very strong and unpleasant ,negative
technically the film is well made with impressive camera work solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ? particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill ,positive
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema ,positive
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end ,positive
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son ,positive
this movie is also revealing ,positive
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue ,positive
and it was boring ,negative
i am so tired of clichs that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast ,negative
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up ,positive
it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect ,positive
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right ,positive
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star ,positive
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself ,positive
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating ,positive
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard ,positive
you won't forget this movie ,positive
why was this film made ,negative
the film has an ultra cheap look to it ,negative
the result is a film that just don't look right ,negative
none of them are engaging or exciting ,negative
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it ,negative
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time ,negative
i saw it as a child on tv back in when it was the stranger and i loved it ,positive
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr ,positive
this movie is so awesome ,positive
i loved it it was really scary ,positive
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there ,positive
if you want a real scare rent this one ,positive
this is an extraordinary film ,positive
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening ,positive
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court ,positive
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen ,positive
this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole ,positive
predictable but not a bad watch ,positive
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part ,positive
she carries the movie well ,positive
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations ,positive
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd ,positive
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong ,negative
in fact this stinker smells like a direct to video release ,negative
avoid at all costs ,negative
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series ,negative
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain ,negative
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards ,negative
the only place good for this film is in the garbage ,negative
the worst one of the series ,negative
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion ,positive
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions ,positive
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way ,positive
of course the footage from the s was grainy but that only enhanced the film ,positive
this film offers many delights and surprises ,positive
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film ,positive
the story unfolds in th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch ,positive
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor ,positive
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression ,positive
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop ,positive
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars ,positive
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch ,positive
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic ,positive
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin playing anatomist doctor quinn ,positive
conclusion i loved it ,positive
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie ,positive
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it ,positive
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with years down the line ,positive
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time ,positive
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism ,positive
"plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job ",positive
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south ,positive
trumbull on i love lucy ,positive
see it with your kids if you have a chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last years ,positive
see both films if you can ,positive
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead ,positive
feelings thoughtsgabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal ,positive
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist ,negative
it's very slow ,negative
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend years between his childhood and mature age ,negative
 don't waste your time ,negative
end of days is one of the worst big budget action movies i've ever seen ,negative
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money ,negative
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen ,negative
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was ,negative
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever ,positive
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the be all end all of brainsucking movies look no further ,positive
 with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough ,positive
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever ,positive
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle ,positive
" hour minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of good lord, what were they thinking ",negative
lots of holes in the script ,negative
it's like a bad two hour tv movie ,negative
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong ,negative
the dialogue is atrocious ,negative
the acting is beyond abysmal ,negative
everything stinks ,negative
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on ,negative
worse there's an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings ,negative
it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time ,negative
in short don't bother with this movie ,negative
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing ,positive
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it ,positive
"if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it ",positive
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame ,positive
a film not easily forgotten ,positive
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ? and totally believable because he is a great actor ,positive
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years ,positive
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable ,positive
"highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular ",positive
great movie ,positive
also the story and acting were weak ,negative
at around pm i bought it at around pm i started to watch at around pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't ,negative
either way it sucks ,negative
the script is horrendously stupid ,negative
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest ,negative
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid ,negative
what the hell kind of crap is that ,negative
then there's the plot holes ,negative
you could drive a semi truck into these holes ,negative
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film ,positive
she's poised and amazing ,positive
dee snider just plain sucks ,negative
"he can't act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen, he can't write did he write this damn movie in his sleep ",negative
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing ,negative
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks ,negative
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably ,negative
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life ,negative
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid ,negative
avoid at any and all costs ,negative
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies ,negative
avoid this film at all costs ,negative
i don't know what happened in season five what a mess ,negative
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict ,negative
now this is a movie i really dislike ,negative
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere ,negative
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 's flicks ,negative
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets ,negative
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible ,negative
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs ,negative
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams ,positive
the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability ,positive
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next ,positive
otherwise don't even waste your time on this ,negative
this one just fails to create any real suspense ,negative
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening ,negative
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film ,positive
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone ,negative
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen ,negative
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying ,negative
hated it ,negative
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed but not quite that bad ,negative
"i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie ",negative
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash ,negative
this is not movie making ,negative
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is ,negative
"so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen ",negative
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it ,positive
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes ,positive
excellent short film ,positive
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film ,positive
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad ,negative
characters are one dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys ,negative
the story line is totally predictable ,negative
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture ,positive
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie ,negative
bad characters bad story and bad acting ,negative
really awful ,negative
not easy to watch ,negative
"funny, clever, hip just like pray's previous film, hype ",positive
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen ,positive
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years ,positive
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie ,positive
i rate this movie / ,positive
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie ,positive
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord ,positive
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience ,positive
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems ,positive
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen ,positive
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with ,positive
this movie is great especially if you enjoy visual arts ,positive
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful ,positive
the story is also both funny and poignant at times ,positive
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie ,positive
this is truly an art movie it actually has a lot of art in it ,positive
go rent it ,positive
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again ,positive
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings ,positive
brilliance indeed ,positive
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you ,positive
think of the film being like a dream ,positive
simply beautiful ,positive
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract ,positive
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver ,positive
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives ,positive
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic ,negative
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub par mess ,negative
the movie seemed a little slow at first ,negative
but it picked up speed and got right to the point ,positive
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget ,positive
i enjoyed it ,positive
i have recommended it to friends ,positive
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz ,positive
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance ,positive
their on screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine ,positive
the film's dialogue is natural real to life ,positive
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character age appropriate ,positive
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film ,positive
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters ,positive
definitely worth seeing? it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness ,positive
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood ,positive
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney/pixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories ,positive
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film ,positive
the art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful ,positive
"if you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible ",negative
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere ,negative
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time ,negative
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost ,positive
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses ,positive
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting ,negative
then i watched it again two sundays ago march th and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing ,positive
it is a very well acted and done tv movie ,positive
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film ,positive
i keep watching it over and over ,positive
it's a sad movie but very good ,positive
"if you have not seen this movie, i definitely recommend it ",positive
"she is as lovely as usual, this cutie ",positive
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow ,positive
; recommend with confidence ,positive
this movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself ,positive
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander ,positive
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot ,positive
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch ,positive
fans of the genre will be in heaven ,positive
lange had become a great actress ,positive
it looked like a wonderful story ,positive
i never walked out of a movie faster ,negative
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off ,negative
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script ,negative
in a word it is embarrassing ,negative
exceptionally bad ,negative
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money ,negative
wow loved this place,positive
crust is not good,negative
not tasty and the texture was just nasty,negative

i could care less the interior is just beautiful,positive
so they performed,positive
that's right the red velvet cake ohhh this stuff is so good,positive
they never brought a salad we asked for,negative
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff,positive
took an hour to get our food only tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed,negative
the worst was the salmon sashimi,negative
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for which is a decent deal,positive
this was like the final blow,negative
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier,positive
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere,negative
overall i like this place a lot,positive
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive,positive
ample portions and good prices,positive
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table,negative
my first visit to hiro was a delight,positive
service sucks,negative
the shrimp tender and moist,positive
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again,negative
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick,negative
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service,positive
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register,negative
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section,positive
it's too bad the food is so damn generic,negative
the burger is good beef cooked just right,positive
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse,positive
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing,positive
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside,positive
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table,positive
their chow mein is so good,positive
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food,negative
the portion was huge,positive
loved it friendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu,positive
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat lined excuse for a restaurant,negative
not much seafood and like strings of pasta at the bottom,negative
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked,positive
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless,negative
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for minutes,negative
this place receives stars for their appetizers,positive
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious,positive
we'd definitely go back here again,positive
we are so glad we found this place,positive
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount,positive
always a great time at dos gringos,positive
update went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,positive
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy,negative
a great way to finish a great,positive
the deal included tastings and drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected,positive
 really really good rice all the time,positive
the service was meh,negative
it took over min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk,negative
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense,negative
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well,negative
 times very bad customer service,negative
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well,positive
today is the second time i've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good,positive
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company,negative
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up,negative
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only others there eating,negative
the turkey and roast beef were bland,negative
this place has it,positive
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old,negative
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try,positive
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying,negative
all i have to say is the food was amazing,positive
omelets are to die for,positive
everything was fresh and delicious,positive
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience,negative
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party,positive
"never been to hard rock casino before, will never ever step forward in it again",negative
best breakfast buffet,positive
say bye bye to your tip lady,negative

it was not good,negative
on the up side their cafe serves really good food,positive
"our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go",positive

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to,positive
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon,positive

nice spicy and tender,positive
good prices,positive
check it out,positive
it was pretty gross,negative
i've had better atmosphere,negative
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did,negative
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing,negative
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine,negative
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries,negative
service was fine and the waitress was friendly,positive
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten,positive
we thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night,positive
"host staff were, for lack of a better word, bitches",negative
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that,negative
phenomenal food service and ambiance,positive
i wouldn't return,negative
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time i'm in vegas,positive
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food,negative
penne vodka excellent,positive
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers,positive
the management is rude,negative
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even,positive
great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations,positive
i had a seriously solid breakfast here,positive
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas,positive
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas,negative
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions,positive
don't do it,negative
the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us,negative
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service,negative
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me,negative
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food,positive
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated,positive
the menu is always changing food quality is going down & service is extremely slow,negative
the service was a little slow considering that were served by people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace,negative
i give it thumbs down,negative
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us,negative
my fianc and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away,positive
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay,positive
we waited for forty five minutes in vain,negative
crostini that came with the salad was stale,negative
some highlights great quality nigiri here,positive
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean,positive
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored,positive
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago,positive
this place is good,positive

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed,negative
i was seated immediately,positive
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced,positive
avoid at all cost,negative
restaurant is always full but never a wait,positive
delicious,positive
this place is hands down one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area,positive
so don't go there if you are looking for good food,negative
i've never been treated so bad,negative
bacon is hella salty,positive
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste,negative
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed,positive
the waitresses are very friendly,positive
"lordy, the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers",positive
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter,positive
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back,negative
the service here leaves a lot to be desired,negative
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness,positive
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while,positive
we literally sat there for minutes with no one asking to take our order,negative
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor,negative
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack,negative
i dressed up to be treated so rudely,negative
it was probably dirt,negative
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor,positive
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible,positive
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined,negative
interesting decor,positive
what i really like there is the crepe station,positive

you can watch them preparing the delicious food,positive
both of the egg rolls were fantastic,positive
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing,negative
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied,positive
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine,negative
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho,positive
the live music on fridays totally blows,negative
i've never been more insulted or felt disrespected,negative
very friendly staff,positive
it is worth the drive,positive
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of,positive
food was great and so was the serivce,positive
the warm beer didn't help,negative
great brunch spot,positive

if that bug never showed up i would have given a for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen,negative
for about minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon,negative
my friend loved the salmon tartar,positive

extremely tasty,positive

the jamaican mojitos are delicious,positive
which are small and not worth the price,negative
 the food is rich so order accordingly,positive
"the shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see",negative
the service was a bit lacking,negative
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables,negative
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in,negative
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad,negative
i loved the bacon wrapped dates,positive
this is an unbelievable bargain,positive
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special,positive
as for the mains also uninspired,negative
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing,positive
this wonderful experience made this place a must stop whenever we are in town again,positive
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people,negative
very very fun chef,positive
ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks,negative
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's,positive
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it,negative
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them,negative
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing,positive
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again,negative
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service,positive
horrible don't waste your time and money,negative
now this dish was quite flavourful,positive
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse,negative
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold,negative
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again,negative
 drinks took close to minutes to come out at one point,negative
seriously flavorful delights folks,positive
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas,positive
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood,positive
based on the sub par service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back,negative
owner's are really great people,positive
there is nothing privileged about working/eating there,negative
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful,positive
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too,negative
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty,positive
we had at our table and the service was pretty fast,positive
fantastic service here,positive
i as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible,negative
they know how to make them here,positive
very tough and very short on flavor,negative
i hope this place sticks around,positive
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water,negative
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite,positive
"good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot",positive
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion,positive

the burger i got the gold standard a burger and was kind of disappointed,negative
"omg, the food was delicioso",positive
there is nothing authentic about this place,negative
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever,negative
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great,positive
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai,positive
it's worth driving up from tucson,positive
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none,negative

this place is like chipotle but better,positive
"classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks baseball steak",positive

i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day,negative
they dropped more than the ball,negative
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable,positive

our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end,positive
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste,positive
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared been stepped in and tracked everywhere pile of green bird poop,negative
"furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website",negative

the manager was the worst,negative
the inside is really quite nice and very clean,positive
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable,positive
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food,negative

we had a group of + when we claimed we would only have and they handled us beautifully,positive
i loved it,positive
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either,negative
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what i've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here,positive
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh,negative
the selection of food was not the best,negative
delicious and i will absolutely be back,positive
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment,positive
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle,positive

it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign,negative
how awesome is that,positive
i will be back many times soon,positive

those burgers were amazing,positive
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was minutes late,negative
and it was way to expensive,negative

"i really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place",positive
nice ambiance,positive
i would recommend saving room for this,positive
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful,negative
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good,negative
"i know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here",negative
avoid this establishment,negative
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough,negative
all of the tapas dishes were delicious,positive
i heart this place,positive
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm,negative
after two i felt disgusting,negative
a good time,positive

over rated,negative
if you look for authentic thai food go else where,negative
their steaks are recommended,positive
after i pulled up my car i waited for another minutes before being acknowledged,negative
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting,positive
all in all i can assure you i'll be back,positive
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives,negative
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar,positive
the kids play area is nasty,negative
great place fo take out or eat in,positive
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options,positive

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus,positive
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever,negative
it'll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix,positive
i really enjoyed crema caf before they expanded; i even told friends they had the best breakfast,positive
not good for the money,negative
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia,positive
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting minutes just to place our order another minutes before the food arrived,negative
they also have the best cheese crisp in town,positive
good value great food great service,positive
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal,positive
the food is good,positive
it was awesome,positive
i just wanted to leave,negative
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed,positive
i will not be eating there again,negative
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one,negative
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed,negative

"sorry, i will not be getting food from here anytime soon ",negative
an absolute must visit,positive
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing,positive
my friend did not like his bloody mary,negative

they really want to make your experience a good one,positive
i will not return,negative
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland,negative
very disappointing,negative
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning,positive
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait,negative
pretty awesome place,positive
ambience is perfect,positive
best of luck to the rude and non customer service focused new management,negative
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one,negative
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself,negative

this is a good joint,positive
the macarons here are insanely good,positive
i'm not eating here,negative

very bad experience,negative
what a mistake,negative
food was average at best,negative
great food,positive
we won't be going back anytime soon,negative

it is perfect for a sit down family meal or get together with a few friends,positive
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed,negative
the patio seating was very comfortable,positive
the fried rice was dry as well,negative
hands down my favorite italian restaurant,positive
that just screams legit in my booksomethat's also pretty rare here in vegas,positive
it was just not a fun experience,positive
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested,positive
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it's amazing what they do with eggplant,positive
"very convenient, since we were staying at the mgm",positive
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous,positive
both great,positive
eclectic selection,positive
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had,positive
the staff was very attentive,positive
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him,positive
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price,positive

the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had,positive
good food good service ,positive
it was absolutely amazing,positive
i probably won't be back to be honest,negative

the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well,positive
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good,positive
went for lunch service was slow,negative
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed,negative
i was mortified,negative
needless to say we will never be back here again,negative
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more,negative
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible,negative
i wasn't really impressed with strip steak,negative
have been going since and every meal has been awesome,positive

"i mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible",negative
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased,positive
not my thing,negative
 thumbs up,positive
if you are reading this please don't go there,negative
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza,positive
only pros large seating area/ nice bar area/ great simple drink menu/ the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough,positive
they have a really nice atmosphere,positive

after one bite i was hooked,positive
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything,negative

a fly was in my apple juice a fly,negative
the han nan chicken was also very tasty,positive
as for the service i thought it was good,positive
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us,negative
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting,negative
nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while,positive
overall i like there food and the service,positive
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world,positive

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper,positive
never had anything to complain about here,positive
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it,positive
it was way over fried,negative
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place,negative
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way,negative
will not be back,negative
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat,positive
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast,positive
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from,positive
"i have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly",negative
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside,positive
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette,positive
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth,positive
level spicy was perfect where spice didn't over whelm the soup,positive
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic,positive
main thing i didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid s and up,negative
"when i'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again",positive
i had to wait over minutes to get my drink and longer to get arepas,negative
this is a great place to eat,positive

the service was poor and thats being nice,negative
food was good service was good prices were good,positive
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale,negative

but the service was beyond bad,negative
i'm so happy to be here,positive
tasted like dirt,negative
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again ,positive
the block was amazing,positive
it's close to my house it's low key non fancy affordable prices good food,positive
 both the hot & sour & the egg flower soups were absolutely stars,positive
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless,negative
great time family dinner on a sunday night,positive
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style,negative
what did bother me was the slow service,negative
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing,positive
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste,negative
these were so good we ordered them twice,positive
so in a nutshell the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer,negative
my girlfriend's veal was very bad,negative
unfortunately it was not good,negative
i had a pretty satifying experience,positive
join the club and get awesome offers via email,positive
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder,positive
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat,negative
the chains which i'm no fan of beat this place easily,negative
the nachos are a must have,positive
we will not be coming back,negative
i don't have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well,positive
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff,positive
great atmosphere friendly and fast service,positive
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there,positive
once your food arrives it's meh,negative
paying for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal,negative
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic,positive
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too,negative
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night,positive
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh,positive
this place is great,positive
mediocre food,negative
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place,positive
i'm super pissd,negative
and service was super friendly,positive
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked,negative
this place was such a nice surprise,positive
they were golden crispy and delicious,positive
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat,negative
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine,positive
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food,negative
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered,positive
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was,positive
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place,negative
the service was terrible though,negative
"this place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is overpriced",negative
it was packed,negative
i love this place,positive
i can say that the desserts were yummy,positive
the food was terrible,negative
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree,positive
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done,negative
this place should honestly be blown up,negative
but i definitely would not eat here again,negative
do not waste your money here,negative
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes,positive
the crpe was delicate and thin and moist,positive
awful service,negative
won't ever go here again,negative
food quality has been horrible,negative
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone,negative
the service here is fair at best,negative
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be over priced over hip and under services,negative
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish,negative
very poor service,negative
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it,negative
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day,positive
they were excellent,positive
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job,negative
just had lunch here and had a great experience,positive
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor,negative
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small,negative
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since,positive
for bucks a head i really expect better food,negative
the food came out at a good pace,positive
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad,positive
i won't be back,negative
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were,negative
this place deserves no stars,negative
i would not recommend this place,negative
in fact i'm going to round up to stars just because she was so awesome,positive
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted,negative
"bad day or not, i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise",negative
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit,positive
i probably would not go here again,negative
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat,positive
the price is reasonable and the service is great,positive
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either,negative
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing,negative
went in for happy hour great list of wines,positive
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot,positive
i probably won't be coming back here,negative
worst food/service i've had in a while,negative
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant,positive
talk about great customer service of course we will be back,positive
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil,negative
i love their fries and their beans,positive
always a pleasure dealing with him,positive
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval,positive
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer,positive
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go,positive
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table,positive
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best,negative
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one,negative
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costco's,negative
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting,positive
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience,positive
weird vibe from owners,negative
there was hardly any meat,negative
i've had better bagels from the grocery store,negative
go to place for gyros,positive
"i love the owner/chef, his one authentic japanese cool dude",positive
now the burgers aren't as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless,negative
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa,negative
the service was terrible food was mediocre,negative
we definately enjoyed ourselves,positive
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs,negative
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate,negative
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore,negative
the service was extremely slow,negative
after minutes wait i got a table,negative
seriously killer hot chai latte,positive
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts,negative
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love,positive
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place,positive
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom,negative
worst thai ever,negative
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once,positive
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service,positive
the pizza selections are good,positive
i had strawberry tea which was good,positive
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron,negative
overall a great experience,positive
spend your money elsewhere,negative
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm,positive
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated,negative
"and the drinks are weak, people",negative
 my order was not correct,negative
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house,negative
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert,negative
the chips and sals a here is amazing,positive
we won't be returning,negative
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot,positive
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off,negative
very very sad,negative
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that",negative
"how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, i don't understand",negative
i'm not impressed with the concept or the food,negative
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it pured,negative
"there is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",negative
i got food poisoning here at the buffet,negative
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no,negative
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us,negative
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon,negative
this place is disgusting,negative
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree,positive
the ri style calamari was a joke,negative
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible,negative
i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch,negative
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it,negative
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it,negative
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get itdefinitely lost the love after this one,negative
disappointing experience,negative
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all,negative
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you,negative
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying,negative
we won't be going back,negative
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it,negative
this place lacked style,negative
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was ridiculous,negative
don't bother coming here,negative
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork,negative
the building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again,negative
it was equally awful,negative
probably not in a hurry to go back,negative
very slow at seating even with reservation,negative
not good by any stretch of the imagination,negative
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked,negative
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat,negative
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor,negative
i was very disappointed,negative
this place is horrible and way overpriced,negative
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best,negative
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why,negative
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu,negative
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits,negative
con spotty service,negative
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger,negative
but then they came back cold,negative
then our food came out disappointment ensued,negative
the real disappointment was our waiter,negative
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything,negative
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach,negative
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it,negative
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart,negative
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door,negative
after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat herewhat a disappointment,negative
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible,negative
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger,negative
but i don't like it,negative
hell no will i go back,negative
we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant,negative
i don't know what the big deal is about this place but i won't be back ya'all,negative
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar,negative
the ambiance isn't much better,negative
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees,negative
the food wasn't good,negative
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked,negative
what happened next was prettyoff putting,negative
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place,negative
overpriced for what you are getting,negative
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch,negative
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become minutes yet still no food,negative
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list,negative
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh,negative
food was below average,negative
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant,negative
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop,negative
the problem i have is that they charge for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables,negative
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only / a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold,negative
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry,negative
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down,negative
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage,negative
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland,negative
spend your money and time some place else,negative
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad,negative
the presentation of the food was awful,negative
i can't tell you how disappointed i was,negative
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking,negative
appetite instantly gone,negative
overall i was not impressed and would not go back,negative
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time,negative
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check,negative
i'm picking up what you're putting down ;,positive
plus you've added commercials to the experience tacky,negative
